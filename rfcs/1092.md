> For legibility and consistency reasons, it's helpful if the order of unordered collections is maintained. For example, an enum describes a set (unordered) of possible values, but it would be irritating if every time you introspected the API or built an SDL for it the enum values were in a different (random) order. This PR recommends that you maintain the initial order that such unordered collections were created with. Theoretically, this means that if you generate SDL from a schema (e.g. via introspection) and then build a new cloned schema from this SDL, generating SDL from this cloned schema (e.g. via introspection) should match the original SDL (i.e. `printSchema(schema) == printSchema(buildClientSchema(introspectionFromSchema(schema)))`)

> This PR builds on #1091 and is a change extracted from #1063 as discussed at [last night's WG meeting](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/notes/2024/2024-04.md#ordering-of-schema-elements-10m-benjie). It does need to be stacked since it also adds the ordering details to Appendix A (originally we thought it might be able to be separate).
