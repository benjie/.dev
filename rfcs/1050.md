> This PR builds on #1065.
> 
> This introduces a directive on operations that disables the null/error propagation behavior by treating all Non-Null types as if they were Semantic-Non-Null types (see #1065).
> 
> The specific name of this directive (currently `@disableNullPropagation`) is open to workshopping:
> 
> - [`@noBubblesPlz` :wink: or `@tepid` :rofl:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5Qec3OvKjU&t=1426s)
> - `@disableNullPropagation` / `@disableErrorPropagation` / `@noNullPropagation` / `@noPropagation` / `@nullOnError` / etc
> - `@localErrors`
> - `@dontHandleErrorsForMeIKnowWhatImDoing`
> - \{your suggestion here}
> 
> Implemented in https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4192 as part of semantic non-null support.
