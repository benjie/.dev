This PR builds on #1048, so you should see the diff from that PR:

https://github.com/benjie/graphql-spec/compare/asterisk...benjie:graphql-spec:no-null-bubbling

This introduces a directive on operations that disables the null/error propagation behavior by treating all Non-Null types as if they were Null-Only-On-Error types (see #1048).

The specific name of this directive (currently `@nullOnError`) is open to workshopping:

- [`@noBubblesPlz` :wink: or `@tepid` :rofl:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5Qec3OvKjU&t=1426s)
- `@disableNullPropagation` / `@disableErrorPropagation` / `@noNullPropagation` / `@noPropagation` / etc
- `@localErrors`
- `@dontHandleErrorsForMeIKnowWhatImDoing`
- \{your suggestion here}

This PR currently only includes a description of the directive and an example; the implementation is yet to come (hence: draft).
