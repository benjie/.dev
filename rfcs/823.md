> Relates to https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/592
> 
> This RFC is to act as a discussion place for operation expressions; an extension to the Schema Coordinates syntax that allows for a host of new use cases.
> 
> I've outlined some of the use cases that have been discussed so far, and have iterated on the syntax a little, but everything in this is very much in flux. The purpose of this PR is to be a place to host the discussion (separate from Schema Coordinates) so that others may bring their ideas to the table. I don't think it's suitable for merging at this time.
