This is a specific change from #777 applied throughout the spec.

The term "query error" feels limited to GraphQL query operations; however the error could be raised from mutations or subscriptions too, in fact it can also be raised when it's not clear what operation is to be executed (e.g. when there's a document with multiple operations, but no `operationName` was provided). As such, the error does not relate specifically to "query", or even "operation", but to the entire GraphQL request.

Relates to https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/546
