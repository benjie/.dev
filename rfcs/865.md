This is a **proposal** to bring Relay-style [Fragment Arguments](https://www.internalfb.com/intern/staticdocs/relay/docs/api-reference/graphql-and-directives/#arguments) into the Spec as an **optional**, **client-only** language feature.

# Overview

We would allow clients to write GraphQL like:
```
query Q1 {
  ...Number(x: 100)
}

query Q2($i: Int = 3) {
  ...Number(x: $i)
}

fragment Number($x: Int!) on Query {
  number(value: $x)
}
```

which would, prior to sending to the server, be transformed into two unique queries that  current spec-compliant servers would understand, such that it behaved like the queries were written like:
```
query Q1 {
  ...Number
}

fragment Number on Query {
  number(value: 100)
}
```
and
```
query Q2($i: Int = 3) {
  ...Number
}

fragment Number on Query {
  number(value: $i)
}
```

The exact mechanics of *how* the query gets rewritten could be different per client, but the *behavior* should be identical. This RFC seeks to describe the new syntax, as well as adding additional validation for clients that choose to support fragment arguments.

# Background

Relay has seen a lot of usage of their non-spec-compliant `@arguments` and `@argumentDefinitions` directives, but they're both cumbersome to use and fail basic Spec validation (directives with arguments used but never defined). They accomplish this by pre-compiling any GraphQL definitions using `@arguments` and `@argumentDefinitions` to transform the document such that, by the time it's sent to the server, it is spec compliant. However, Relay's user-facing directives both do not conform to the spec and also provide a pretty cumbersome, somewhat unintuitive user-facing design.

This proposal is to allow clients that pre-compile their GraphQL prior to sending it to the server (such as Relay) to have a built-in syntax for passing argument values into fragment spreads for fragments with well-defined argument definitions.
