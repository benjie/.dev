This change would make the root `query` operation type optional, consistent with `mutation` and `subscription`. In this proposal, schema introspection would still work as before, by allowing a "default" `query` type if one is not defined, exposing only the implicit fields `__schema` and `__types` (in response to PR feedback).

The change is worded so that a "schema must define at least one root operation type.". See below for motivation and alternatives.

See #490 for background on this issue.

### Motivation

Not all GraphQL APIs need a `query` interface but do fine with just `mutation` or `subscription`. This becomes especially apparent for micro services. Such services are forced to expose dummy query fields, with real world examples such as `_`, `version`, `helloWorld`, or `dontQueryMe`.

### Alternative: Allow root query operation type to be empty

Instead of making the root `query` operation type optional, it can be allowed to not have any fields. 

This has already been proposed (see #606), but would have wider impacts than just making `query` optional. A benefit of this approach is that schema introspection wouldn't need any new treatment.

Allowing for only the query root, or others, to be empty would require​ validating that type in the context of how it's used, which seems strange to me (e.g. if a type is only allowed to be empty if it's called `Query` or is used in `schema { query: Query }`).

### Alternative: Don't require​ any root type

A schema which only defines types without any operations _could_ be useful in some scenarios, where a schema in service A is perhaps stitched or used as the basis for another. To support this, one could drop the requirement "A schema must define at least one root operation type."

I think this would be esoteric and counter to existing requirements enforcing a "useful" schema (for example requiring composite types not to be empty).
