> > :: A _response position_ is a uniquely identifiable position in the response
> data produced during execution. It is either a direct entry in the \{resultMap}
> of a \{ExecuteSelectionSet()}, or it is a position in a (potentially nested) List
> value. Each response position is uniquely identifiable via a _response path_.
> 
> The intention of _response position_ is that it includes things that were elided by error propagation; e.g. if you query `{ a { b } }` and `b` is non-null and throws, the result will be `{a: null}` but the error will have path `["a", "b"]` indicating the `a.b` response position even though that position does not actually exist in the response.
> 
> (Also: `ExecuteSelectionSet()` doesn't exist any more.)
> 
> **Commit 1**: clarify definition of response position to include these omitted values.
> 
> ---
> 
> > If a _response position_ resolves to \{null} because of an execution error which
> has already been added to the \{"errors"} list in the _execution result_, the
> \{"errors"} list must not be further affected. That is, only one error should be
> added to the errors list per _response position_.
> 
> But the _response position_ mentioned at the beginning of this paragraph _is different to_ the response position from which the error originated; therefore "only one error should be added to the errors list per _response position_" is kind of moot. Actually what we mean here is that the _response path_ of the error (i.e. the "path" entry in the error object) should be unique.
> 
> **Commit 2**: clarify it's the "path" of the error that matters, not the position that re-raised it
> 
> ---
> 
> The use of the term "response position" is confusing, because that position might not actually exist in the response if it was omitted due to error propagation.
> 
> **Commit 3**: rename `response position` to `execution position` throughout.
> 
> ---
> 
> All of this together clarifies what happens when an error occurs to a nullable sibling of a non-nullable field that triggers error propagation.
