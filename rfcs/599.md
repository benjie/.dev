GraphQL syntactical grammars intend to be unambiguous. While lexical grammars should also be - there has historically been an assumption that lexical parsing is greedy. This is obvious for numbers and words, but less obvious for empty block strings.

Either way, the additional clarity removes ambiguity from the spec

Fixes #572
