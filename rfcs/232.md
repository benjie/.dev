This brings together many of the considerations about a `__id` unique identifier field into one document. There is still a lot of work to do before this becomes a merge-able diff on the spec:
- [ ] Agree on field semantics specified in this PR
- [ ] Restructure the spec so that the description for `__id` can live next to `__typename`
- [ ] Write the change to the spec
