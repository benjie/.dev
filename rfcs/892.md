> Was already discussed during WG: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/notes/2021-04-01.md#adding-descriptions-to-queries-and-fragments-ivan
> 
> I prepare a format proposal, here is a couple of key points:
> 1. You can add descriptions on operations, fragments, and query variables
> 2. You can't add description on the short form of operation only full form.
> 
> Example:
> ```
> "Some description"
> query SomeOperation(
>   "ID you should provide"
>   $id: String
>   
>   "Switch for experiment ...."
>   $enableBaz: Boolean = false,
> ) {
>   foo(id: $id) {
>     bar
>     baz @include(if: $enableBaz) {
>       ...BazInfo
>     }
>   }
> }
> 
> "Some description here"
> fragment BazInfo on Baz {
>   # ...
> }
> ```
