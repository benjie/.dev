> This fully specifies the Fragment Arguments changes required, as evidenced by the implementation changes made to `graphql-js` in https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3835
> 
> This is an update to a years-old RFC PR https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/865, but given that PR had a lot of discussion that has been resolved, it should be easier for reviewers to start with this PR as a cleaner slate. I've tried to incorporate all discussion from previous PRs and Working Group discussion into the initial commit here.
