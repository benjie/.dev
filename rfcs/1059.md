> For the following schema:
> 
> ```graphql
> type Query {
>   sum(numbers:[Int!]!): Int
> }
> ```
> 
> The following query is currently valid:
> 
> ```graphql
> query Q ($number: Int = 3) {
>   sum(numbers: [1, $number, 3])
> }
> ```
> 
> This query will accept the variables `{"number": null}` and result in a runtime _field error_ when it turns out that `null` cannot be used in this non-nullable list value position. This was discussed in depth in the December 2022 Secondary EU WG meeting, resulting in this action item https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1337.

> 
> This PR implements the agreed solution: it introduces a stricter version of the All Variable Usages Are Allowed algorithm which forbids a nullable variable from being used in a non-nullable position; and to support existing documents a legacy version of the old algorithm is maintained (basically a copy/paste).
> 
> Under the new strict algorithm, the previous query becomes invalid and you'd need to make the variable type non-nullable:
> 
> ```graphql
> query Q ($number: Int! = 3) {
>   sum(numbers: [1, $number, 3])
> }
> ```
> 
> This still allows the variable `$number` to be omitted, but it does not allow it to be explicitly `null`.
> 
> **IMPORTANT NOTE**: this new algorithm does not allow an argument/input object field's default value to be used if a variable is used as the value for that argument/input object field. A workaround is to copy the argument/input object field's default value to the variable definition, but this will mean that changes to the argument/input object field's default value will not be reflected by existing queries. I think this is acceptable, since there's no way to leverage the default value of an argument when passing a literal to it either - I'm in favour of literal/variable equivalence where possible, and I think that the benefits of turning this runtime error into a validation error outweigh the costs.
