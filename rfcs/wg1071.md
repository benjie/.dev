Whilst talking with @IvanGoncharov about metadata and the need for a structured type that's valid on both input and output, Ivan suggested that we might have a scalar "model" an input object, such that the scalar (which is valid on input and output) could be given a structure. Hot on the heels of [`@oneOf`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/825) I wondered if we could just give `input` more powers and explored this idea further, and the **[struct RFC](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/Struct.md)** is the result of that exploration. It turns out that doing this would solve [a](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/688) [number](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/237) [of](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/929) [the](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/127) [open](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/147) [issues](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/942) people have discussed in the GraphQL spec repository issues, and may also be a more suitable solution to input polymorphism.

**Think of struct as "a scalar with structure".** A struct represents some fixed data, like `{ "type": "Feature", "geometry": { "type": "Point", "coordinates": [125.6, 10.1] }, "properties": { "name": "Dinagat Islands" } }`, that could be sent from the client to the server, or from the server to the client, as an "atom" - without any further resolution.

No resolvers. No field arguments. No infinite recursion. Just pure data.

The struct type could be implemented as:

1. an enhancement over a scalar, giving the scalar fields and thus structure
2. an enhancement of input, allowing it to be used on output
3. a new "struct" type.

Given Lee pushed towards (3) for the ["tagged type"](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/733) when exploring oneOf, I explored that first. The problem that came up was the same one that came up for using scalars (1): it suddenly becomes unclear when an input object should be used, versus when a struct should be used. So it was clear that option (2) was the most promising.

The biggest issue I see with option (2) is literally the name: "input". Using a type named "input" for output would certainly be unexpected. But since that's potentially just a "historical accident" letâ€‹'s ignore that for now :wink: 

I've used the keyword `struct` in the RFC, but it does not need a new keyword (reusing `input` would be fine), I just wanted to make the distinction clear and to not have to rewrite everything if we chose an option other than (2) in future.

In the RFC I've laid out [a number of justifications](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/Struct.md#why) why the struct type is useful, [what it might look like](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/Struct.md#what-could-it-look-like), and have even explored [what (optional) selection sets over the type might look like](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/Struct.md#selection-sets).

If you have feedback on this RFC, this is the place to raise it before our next working group on August.

Thanks to @IvanGoncharov, @michaelstaib and @andimarek for helping shape this RFC with their feedback.
