> This PR addresses a spec validation omission; if an interface field is not deprecated then any implementation of that interface field should also not be deprecated. I.e. the following schema _should_ be invalid, but before this PR it is valid:
> 
> ```graphql
> interface Node {
>   id: ID!
> }
> 
> type Foo implements Node {
>   id: ID! @deprecated(reason: "...")
> }
> 
> type Query {
>   foo: Foo
> }
> ```
> 
> To solve this, either the deprecation should be removed, or the `id` field on `Node` should _also_ be deprecated:
> 
> ```graphql
> interface Node {
>   id: ID! @deprecated(reason: "...")
> }
> ```
> 
> 
> Relevant action item: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/issues/1331
> 
> GraphQL.js Implementation: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3986
