This PR addresses a spec validation omission; if an interface field is not deprecated then any implementation of that interface field should also not be deprecated. I.e. the following schema _should_ be invalid, but before this PR it is valid:

```graphql
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

type Foo implements Node {
  id: ID! @deprecated(reason: "...")
}

type Query {
  foo: Foo
}
```

To solve this, either the deprecation should be removed, or the `id` field on `Node` should _also_ be deprecated:

```graphql
interface Node {
  id: ID! @deprecated(reason: "...")
}
```
