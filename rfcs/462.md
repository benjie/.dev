Throughtout the spec we refer to input and output types but never clearly define them in a referenced section. This adds that section and removes the ad-hoc descriptions from elsewhere in the spec.

It also uses the formal algorithms in place of prose where relevant.

Finally it adds to the schema validation rules for Object, Interface, and Input Object fields / arguments.

Fixes #447
