> Throughtout the spec we refer to input and output types but never clearly define them in a referenced section. This adds that section and removes the ad-hoc descriptions from elsewhere in the spec.
> 
> It also uses the formal algorithms in place of prose where relevant.
> 
> Finally it adds to the schema validation rules for Object, Interface, and Input Object fields / arguments.
> 
> Fixes #447
