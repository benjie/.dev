supersedes  #1026 

This version sets up an Incremental Publisher Record that includes:
(a) an Execution Event Queue input stream on the and
(b) a Subsequent Result output stream.

No mutations happen outside the algorithms that define any records.

With the following caveats:
1. The event queue is not considered to be "mutated" when different sub-algorithms push events into it.
2. The `CreateIncrementalPublisher()` algorithm is where the magic happens, a long algorithm where the Execution Event Handler and lazily executed Subsequent Result stream are managed concurrently. To increase readability, several subprocedures/macros/inner functions are defined that have access to the variables defined within the entire algorithm.
