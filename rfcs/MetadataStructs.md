> # Metadata Structs
> 
> **THIS PROPOSAL HAS BEEN SUPERCEDED BY
> [AnnotationStructs](./AnnotationStructs.md).**
> 
> Schema metadata has long been desired, please see this long discussion:
> 
> https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/300
> 
> I digested many of the currently proposed (and in the wild) solutions to this
> problem in my talk at the GraphQL Conference, you can see the talk here:
> 
> https://youtu.be/c1oa7p73rTw
> 
> It covers:
> 
> - custom introspection extensions
> - 'SDL' field in schema, like Apollo Federation
> - storing metadata in the description field
> - adding metadata entirely in user-space
> - 'applied directives'
> 
> It expands on the pros and cons of these approaches and asks "is there a better
> solution".
> 
> ## Problems
> 
> Some of the main problems that need to be solved with schema metadata are:
> 
> - representing all desired metadata (including polymorphic metadata)
> - the need for granularity (partial introspection)
> - the need for support in tooling (e.g. GraphiQL) to give visibility into the
>   metadata
> - being able to fully introspect the GraphQL schema in a small number of
>   roundtrips
> - avoiding the need for complex parsing on the client
> - allowing for future expansion of the metadata/introspection schema (without
>   namespace clashes)
> 
> ### Granularity
> 
> It can be useful for clients to include small introspection queries as part of
> their applications - for example you might introspect a particular named enum to
> make available sorting options in a dropdown. If the schema adds support for a
> new sort method, the client could add this option to the dropdown without
> needing to be updated thanks to introspection. However, enum values don't
> currently contain enough information for this.
> 
> Consider that we add a "label" property to the metadata for each enum value -
> then we would have all we need to display it to the user, so long as they spoke
> that language. To cater to an international audience, we could add many
> translations to each enum value - but now the size of the introspection has
> grown. A better solution might be to allow the client to select just the
> translation that it needs from the enum value. (We also don't need any of the
> other metadata for the enum values, only the labels.)
> 
> ## Solution
> 
> This RFC proposes what I feel is a more capable and elegant solution than any of
> the previously proposed solutions covered by my talk, but it's predicated on the
> existence of a polymorphic-capable composite type that can be used symmetrically
> for both input and output. As it happens there's [an RFC for that](./Struct.md),
> so you can see this metadata RFC as an extension of that Struct RFC.
> 
> ### SDL
> 
> `meta` keyword, very similar to `directive`, defines the meta types and fields.
> The type of each field can be any type that is suitable on both input and output
> (i.e. scalar, enum, struct, struct union, and wrapping types thereof).
> 
> ```graphql
> meta +source(table: String, column: String, service: ServiceSource) on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
> meta +visibility(only: [VisibilityScope!]!) required on OBJECT
> meta +label(en: String, fr: String, de: String) on ENUM_VALUE
> 
> struct ServiceSource {
>   serviceName: string
>   identifier: string
> }
> 
> enum VisibilityScope {
>   NONE
>   PERSONAL
>   TEAM
>   ORGANIZATION
>   ADMINS
>   PUBLIC +label(en: "Anyone", fr: "Tout les monde", de: "Alle")
> }
> 
> type User +source(table: "public.users") +visibility(only: [ORGANIZATION]) {
>   id: ID!
>   organization: Organization!
>   username: String! +source(column: "handle")
>   avatar: String! +source(service: {
>     serviceName: "S3"
>     identifier: "/avatars/27.png"
>   })
> }
> ```
> 
> Note: `+visibility` is marked as `required`; in user space it must be defined
> explicitly for each object, but for introspection types it is omitted.
> 
> ### Introspection
> 
> Introspection query example:
> 
> ```graphql
> {
>   User: __type(name: "User") {
>     meta
>     # Or:
>     meta {
>       source {
>         table
>       }
>       visibility {
>         only
>       }
>     }
>   }
>   VisibilityScope: __type(name: "VisibilityScope") {
>     enumValues {
>       name
>       meta {
>         label {
>           en
>         }
>       }
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> Changes to the schema introspection types:
> 
> ```graphql
> type __Schema {
>   metas: [__Meta!]!
> }
> 
> # Similar to __Directive
> type __Meta {
>   name: String!
>   description: String
>   locations: [__MetaLocation!]!
>   isRequired: Boolean!
>   #Â Always a struct; the fields of the struct are the parameters of the meta
>   type: __Type
> }
> 
> type __Type {
>   #...
>   meta: __TypeMeta
> }
> 
> struct __TypeMeta {
>   source: __Meta_source
> 
>   # Though +visibility was defined as 'required', it is only required on
>   # user-space object types, and thus it is nullable here.
>   visibility: __Meta_visibility
> }
> 
> # Auto-generated via `__Meta_` + meta name?
> struct __Meta_source {
>   table: String
>   service: ServiceSource
> }
> 
> struct __Meta_visibility {
>   only: [VisibilityScope!]!
> }
> 
> type __Field {
>   meta: __FieldMeta
> }
> type __EnumValue {
>   meta: __EnumValueMeta
> }
> # etc
> ```
