> The implementation and spec changes show how one can start executing deferred fragments semi-immediately (i.e. after deferring in an implementation-specific way), rather than waiting for the entire initial result to be emitted. This is not required -- one could still be compliant with the spec by deferring all the way until the initial result completes! In fact, how one defers is not per se observable and so the spec cannot mandate much about it with great normative force. But -- and I think this is important -- this PR and the implementation PR provide an algorithm/implementation/spec changes that give servers the flexibility to do what they think is right in that regard, and that might be desirable.

But an individual `Deferred Fragment` Record may consist of a number of distinct `Deferred Grouped Field Set` records, which may overlap with other `Deferred Fragment` Records and should not be sent more than once. `Deferred Grouped Field Set` records are therefore a unit of `Incremental Data` and are tracked with a new record type. `Stream Items` records always contain a single unit of incremental data that is sent only once with little complication; they therefore represent both `Subsequent Result` and `Incremental Data` Records.
