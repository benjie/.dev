> GraphQL.js uses a `getFieldDef()` helper:

> https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/9032db1e4e55052bead6936359ecc5592c817f64/src/execution/execute.ts#L1047-L1079
> 
> called from `executeField()` to get the field definition to execute; returning meta-field definitions as appropriate.
> 
> This spec change reflects this existing behavior as best we can.
> 
> (Technically GraphQL.js' `executeField()` function overlaps responsibilities between the `ExecuteField()` and `ExecuteCollectedFields()` algorithms in the spec - specifically, `executeField()` may return `undefined`, resulting in `executeFields()` not adding the entry to the result object, whereas this conditional addition is handled in `ExecuteCollectedFields()` in the spec and we cannot/should not differentiate between `null` and `undefined` in this way.)
