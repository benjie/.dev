This is an alternative solution to #776 wherein `__typename` is explicitly allowed inspired by @IvanGoncharov's [comment on that PR](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/776#issuecomment-738079711).

## Description of issue

`__typename` does not return an event stream, so it does not make sense to allow for it to be [the source stream](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Source-Stream) in a GraphQL subscription operation. As currently specified, the following query passes validation, but it should always produce an error since the [ResolveFieldEventStream](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#ResolveFieldEventStream()) algorithm cannot resolve a subscription `resolver` for `__typename`:

```graphql
subscription {
  __typename
}
```

Separately; it's valid to add `__typename` to any selection set in any GraphQL operation _except_ the root selection set (including fragments) on a Subscription operation. This exclusion complicates life for various GraphQL tooling; it's desirable that this (currently invalid) GraphQL operation be valid:

```graphql
subscription sub {
  newMessage {
    body
    sender
  }
  __typename
}
```

The current GraphQL algorithm for subscriptions operates in two steps; first it resolves the "source stream" from the root field that will generate the subscription events, and then when an event is received it executes the entire operation (NOTE: not just the selection set of the source stream's field, but the entire selection set of the operation) using this event as the `initialValue`. As such, `__typename` _could_ be valid in the root selection set so long as there is exactly one field capable of providing the source stream.

## Solution outline

- Change validation for subscription operations so that instead of saying the root selection set must include exactly one field, it's now exactly one _non-introspection_ field.
- Change `CreateSourceEventStream` such that it uses this non-introspection field as the event source (i.e. so that it ignores introspection fields).
