> As an alternative to #1058 and #1178 - this is a more substantial overhaul of how input value coercion is defined in favor of a system of composed algorithms.
> 
> ## A quick summary of what this introduces:
> 
> - Introduces the concept of a _coercion failure_ which has a similar "raised error" behavior, but is caught and translated into specific errors based on each callsite. That removes the awkwardness of "a request error is actually an execution error here".
> 
> - A new "Input Coercion" section which defines `CoerceInputValue()`. This is the point of reusability which handles nullability and then forks out to each specific input type.
> 
> - Algorithms for each kind of type's input coercion. Notably input objects and lists which have been under-defined (as an alt to #1058).
> 
> - A validation rule for default variable values, which I believe exists in graphql.js but was missing in spec.
> 
> 
> 
> ## Open Qs:
> 
> - Is this the right place for the Input Coercion subsection?
> 
> - Have I missed anything?
