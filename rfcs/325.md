In some of our tool, we need to be able to pass an arbitrary value as an argument of a directive, i.e. value which can be anything and can’t be described as a single type.  The only workaround we found is to define `scalar JSON` which can accept any JSON value including objects and arrays.

Moreover, this as popular approach in the community:
 - Graph.cool and Scaphold both allow user to use `JSON` scalar in their schema
 - [graphql-type-json](https://github.com/taion/graphql-type-json) implements such scalar as a NPM package with 20+ packages [depending on it](https://www.npmjs.com/browse/depended/graphql-type-json).
 - Apollo uses `scalar JSON` as an example in [their documentation](http://dev.apollodata.com/tools/graphql-tools/scalars.html#Using-a-package).

AFAIK, this technique doesn’t contradict GraphQL spec and solves issues at hand.
At the moment, it has very limited support from tooling since it’s not a built-in type and introspection provides you no clue beyond the name of a scalar.  
 
The idea behind this PR is to formalize existing practice for creating `scalar JSON` but in protocol agnostic way, that’s why I propose to use `Any` as the name.

The last argument I have is that all type system that I know have some form of opt-out type: `any` in Flow and TypScript, `void*` in C/C++, `sql_variant` in SQL and `Object` class​ in C#/JAVA.
