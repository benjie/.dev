> This fixes #295 by describing the way in which an interface may implement another interface. The rules are essentially identical to the rules governing implementation of an interface by an object. I'd be more than happy to champion this change (per the CONTRIBUTING.md process) so please direct any questions my way.
> 
> This is a pretty small change, but adds substantially to the expressiveness of GraphQL's type system.
> 
> If someone in the WG can give me a nod, I'll go ahead and implement it in [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js).
> 
> Thanks in advance!
