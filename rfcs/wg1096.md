> Given the revived discussion around schema metadata and their relationship with SDL directives, I'd like to propose a high level direction for this. My goal here is to introduce something with as few additional moving parts as possible. It's intended to be simple rather than robust.
> 
> The primary new mechanism is being able to mark an SDL Directive definition as `metadata` and exposing such directive usages via introspection. Given an introspection result you should be able to re-create the SDL with directive usages in the right places.
> 
> The main downside is that the introspection encoding is simple to the point of requiring post-processing. There is no explicit sub-selection; all metadata gets exposed in introspection. The metadata is not in a structured JSON form, but in arrays of named groups - however this more clearly maps to the way directives are being used. It's up to tools consuming metadata to interpret these as intended.
> 
> I'd love feedback on this!
> 
> ```graphql
> # An SDL directive can now be marked as `metadata`, mirroring how it can be 
> # marked as `repeatable`. Doing so causes usages of it within a schema to be 
> # visible via introspection.
> 
> directive @myCustomMetadata(myValue: String) metadata repeatable on FIELD
> 
> # This appears in introspection as well. `__Directive` gains an `isMetadata` 
> # field, again mirroring the existing `isRepeatable` field.
> 
> type __Directive {
>   # ...
>   isMetadata: Boolean
> }
> 
> # Once a directive is marked as a "metadata" directive, then usages of it appear
> # as metadata at that location in the schema.
> #
> # Schema introspection types all get a `metadata` field, of type `[__Metadata]`.
> # This allows multiple pieces of metadata per location in an introspected schema.
> #
> # As `metadata` is a list, this allows for retaining their order (which spec 
> # preserves as potentially meaningful) as well as repeated directives.
> #
> # No changes are needed to SDL, since we're using existing directive syntax.
> 
> type __Field {
>   # ...
>   metadata: [__Metadata!] # Example of this being added to all things.
> }
> 
> # The `__Metadata` type models a single metadata directive usage at a location.
> # Therefore it both refers to the directive definition being used, as well as
> # the values being used.
> #
> # Note that `values` could be null in the case of a directive usage without args
> # ex: `{ myField @myDirective }`. Also note that since `values` is a list, that
> # the order of the directive arguments can be preserved.
> 
> type __Metadata {
>   """
>   Additional information provided for an item in a GraphQL schema.
>   """
> 
>   directive: __Directive!
>   values: [__MetadataValue!]
> }
> 
> # A `__MetadataValue` is very similar to the existing `__InputValue`. However,
> # as it represents a provided value instead of a definition of a value, only the 
> # `name` and `value` fields are relevant.
> #
> # Similar to `defaultValue` in `__InputValue`, the `value` argument is a String 
> # encoding using the GraphQL language. This allows all varities of values which
> # can be modeled as a GraphQL value. Tools may prefer to convert this to JSON 
> # after fetching.
> 
> type __MetadataValue {
>   name: String!
>   value: String!
> }
> ```
> 
> That's it! Let's take a look at an example:
> 
> ```graphql
> # For this type's `myField` field, a metadata directive is used with a value provided.
> 
> type MyType {
>   myField: Int @myCustomMetadata(myValue: "some value")
> }
> 
> # Given a typical introspection query, here's some additional fields queried on 
> # field during introspection:
> 
> fragment FieldMetadata on __Field {
>   metadata {
>     directive { name }
>     values {
>       name
>       value
>     }
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> And here's the resulting introspection response (in JSON5) for this particular fragment applying to the `myField`
> 
> ```json5
> {
>   name: "myField",
>   // ....
>   metadata: [
>     {
>       directive: { name: "myCustomMetadata" },
>       values: [
>         { 
>           name: "myValue",
>           value: "\"some value\"" // Note GraphQL encoding.
>         }
>       ]
>     }
>   ]
> }
> 
> ```
