I suggest allowing to specify directives on directives with the following syntax:
```
directive @foo on DIRECTIVE_DEFINITION
directive @bar on FIELD @foo
```

## Motivation

Allow applying directive-exclusive features (e.g. `@specifyBy`, `@deprecate`) on directives.

## Validation

We already have a rule in place that prevent cycles in directives
> A directive definition must not contain the use of a directive that references itself indirectly by referencing a Type or Directive which transitively includes a reference to this directive.

https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-HAHnBTDDABAB_F_kC

So validation is already in place and already paid "complexity cost".
