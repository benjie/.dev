Sometimes, product code might only be interested in the existence of an object. Currently, this forces a workaround of either querying `__typename` or adding a bool field like `has_thing`.

It seems natural and not too confusing to allow empty selections:

```
query {
  event {
    location \{\}
  }
}
```

The response should either return `null` or an empty object for `location`.

(The spec changes are incomplete.)
