We now have PRs for Fragment Arguments in `graphql-js`: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3835 and `graphql-spec`: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1010

This discussion will include threads for all open questions and TODOs, and should be the source of truth for discussion about what is left to do or consider, while the PRs should be focused on discussion around the reference and spec implementations.
