> This is a follow-up to #825 that proposes adding the `@oneOf` directive to object types (output objects).
> 
> This is a draft right now as I've not yet had time to think through it well enough, but it raises a few questions:
> 
> 1. The proposed resolution algorithm is a slight divergence from the status quo, omitting fields from the response rather than setting them null. This makes it align with #825, but is it desired? Should we change #825 to only requireâ€‹ one non-null field rather than just one field?
> 2. Should we allow aliases? The current proposed resolution algorithm ensures that every identical field requested on a `@oneOf` selection set will get the same value, but it does so in a somewhat awkward way. Forbidding aliases could remove the need for this.
> 3. What happens if a `@oneOf` is queried as part of a union? The proposed resolution algorithm allows for this by leaving it up to the implementation, I think this is probably best unless anyone has a better idea?
> 
> TODO:
> 
> - [ ] When validating the schema, forbid `@oneOf` on operation types.
> - [ ] Tidy up the language around maps/accessing keys.
> 
> Note this PR is based off of #825, so this is probably the diff you want:
> 
> https://github.com/benjie/graphql-spec/compare/oneof-v2..oneof-output
> 
> 
> Other notes:
> 
> - Seems like `@stream`, `@defer`, `@skip` and `@include` are all compatible with oneOf.
> - Aliases don't need to cause a problem; they'll make the client's life harder, but if it's the client requesting it then that's their problem :laughing: 
> - The fields on a `@oneOf` don't have their own traditional resolvers, instead the parent value must dictate which key/value was returned. This prevents confusion where the same field being requested multiple times (`{ a1: a, a2: a, a3: a }`) could result in different values - we explicitly prevent this from happening.
