> This PR replaces #1046. Here's an updated description:
> 
> Inspired by @captbaritone's True Nullability Schema discussion (https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/discussions/1394) and following @fotoetienne's excellent talk at GraphQLConf and feedback on my resulting PR #1046, I am proposing that we introduce a new wrapper type, the "Null-Only-On-Error" type, represented via asterisk `*`. This new type walks the line between the default nullable types and the existing Non-Null type wrapper - it states that the value may only be \{null} if a field error has been raised - i.e. it represents the "true nullability" of the field, whilst still acting as an error boundary to avoid null propagation.
> 
> Critically, this type would "evaporate" for legacy clients, appearing the same as a nullable field. (This is enabled via the `includeNullOnlyOnError` argument to the `__Field.type` field, which defaults to `false`.)
> 
> This is a much more complete RFC that #1046 was, and happily leverages a lot of the existing behavior of the spec.
