Iterating on #1034 and #1026, removed mutation of internal state, event stream management, and the need for subprocedures.

YieldSubsequentPayloads now is passed the entirety of the "state," pending futures, etc, monitors for any changes to pending futures, rebuilds a new "state" representation based on any changes, yields a single result as necessary, and then recursively calls itself to yield remaining results. 

[The diff to main might be helpful, but this is built on top of the amazing #742 and so the diff [from that branch could be more useful](https://github.com/robrichard/graphql-spec/compare/incremental...yaacovCR:graphql-spec:deduplicate3).]
