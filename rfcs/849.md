> This spec text implements #687 (full context and details there) and also introduces a new escape sequence.
> 
> Three distinct changes:
> 
> 1. Change SourceCharacter to allow points above 0xFFFF, now to 0x10FFFF.
> 2. Allow surrogate pairs within StringValue. This handles illegal pairs with a parse error.
> 3. Introduce new syntax for full range code point EscapedUnicode. This syntax (`\u{1F37A}`) has been adopted by many other languages and I propose GraphQL adopt it as well.
> 
> (As a bonus, this removes the last instance of a regex in the lexer grammar!)
> 
> Reference implementation https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3117
> 
> Closes #687
> Closes #214
