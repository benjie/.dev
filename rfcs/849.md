This spec text implements #687 (full context and details there) and also introduces a new escape sequence.

Three distinct changes:

1. Change SourceCharacter to allow points above 0xFFFF, now to 0x10FFFF.
2. Allow surrogate pairs within StringValue. This handles illegal pairs with a parse error.
3. Introduce new syntax for full range code point EscapedUnicode. This syntax (`\u{1F37A}`) has been adopted by many other languages and I propose GraphQL adopt it as well.

(As a bonus, this removes the last instance of a regex in the lexer grammar!)

Reference implementation https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3117

Closes #687
Closes #214
