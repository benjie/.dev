> [Coercing Field Arguments](http://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Coercing-Field-Arguments) states:
> 
> > 5.c. Let defaultValue be the default value for argumentDefinition.
> > [...]
> > 5.h. If hasValue is not true and defaultValue exists (including null):
> > 5.h.i. Add an entry to coercedValues named argumentName with the value defaultValue.
> > [...]
> > 5.j.iii.1. If value cannot be coerced according to the input coercion rules of argumentType, throw a field error.
> > 5.j.iii.2. Let coercedValue be the result of coercing value according to the input coercion rules of argumentType.
> > 5.j.iii.3. Add an entry to coercedValues named argumentName with the value coercedValue.
> 
> Here we note that there is no run-time coercion of `defaultValue`, which makes sense (why do at runtime that which can be done at build time?). However, there doesn't seem to be a rule that specifies that `defaultValue` must be coerced at all, which leads to consequences:
> 
> 1. you could use any value for defaultValue and it could break the type safety guarantees of GraphQL
> 2. [nested defaultValues are not applied](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/385)
> 
> When building the following GraphQL schema programmatically (code below) with GraphQL.js:
> 
> ```graphql
> type Query {
>   example(inputObject: ExampleInputObject! = {}): Int
> }
> 
> input ExampleInputObject {
>   number: Int! = 3
> }
> ```
> 
> And a resolver for `Query.example`:
> 
> ```js
> resolve(source, args) {
>   return args.inputObject.number;
> }
> ```
> 
> You might expect the following queries to all gave the same result:
> 
> ```graphql
> query A {
>   example
> }
> query B {
>   example(inputObject: {})
> }
> query C {
>   example(inputObject: { number: 3 })
> }
> query D($inputObject: ExampleInputObject! = {}) {
>   example(inputObject: $inputObject)
> }
> ```
> 
> However, it turns out that query A's result differs:
> 
> ```json
> {"example":null}
> {"example":3}
> {"example":3}
> {"example":3}
> ```
> 
> This is because `defaultValue` for `Query.example(inputObject:)` was not coerced, so none of the defaultValues of `ExampleInputObject` were applied.
> 
> This is extremely unexpected, because looking at the GraphQL schema definition it looks like there's no circumstance under which `ExampleInputObject` may not have `number` as an integer; however when the `defaultValue` of `Query.example(inputObject:)` is used, the value of `number` is `undefined`.

> This was [raised against GraphQL.js back in 2016](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/385), but @IvanGoncharov closed it early last year stating that GraphQL.js conforms to the GraphQL Spec in this regard.
> 
> My proposal is that when a `defaultValue` is specified, the GraphQL implementation should coerce it to conform to the relevant type just like it does for runtime values as specified in [Coercing Variable Values](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Coercing-Variable-Values) and [Coercing Field Arguments](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Coercing-Field-Arguments).
