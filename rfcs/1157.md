> When validating a document, the custom scalar coercion rules are not always known. In those cases, it's impossible to validate them. 
> 
> For an example, with this operation, it's impossible to detect that `"InvalidDate"` is not a valid `Date` without knowledge of the coercing rules:
> 
> ```graphql
> {
>   events(after: "InvalidDate") {
>     title
>     startsAt
>   }
> }
> ```
> 
> I think (but wouldn't bet on it) that this is already the case in graphql-js for an example? 
> 
> Excluding those from the validation feels like a better reflection of the current state of things albeit probably a spec change.
