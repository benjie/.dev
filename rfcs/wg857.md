> In an ideal world, fragments would be *so modular* that our validation rules would be inductive: if Query Q depends on Fragment B and C, then so long as we know fragments B and C are valid, and we run validation on Q against B and C's type declarations (i.e. just the `fragment B on Foo` portion of the fragment definition, the stuff before the selection set brackets `{ ... }`), then we know Q is valid.
> 
> I'm hoping this discussion helps us clarify the work required to set us in that direction, and makes sure related projects, like [Client Controlled Nullability](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/895), are at least compatible with this evolution.
> 
> Currently I see three different "solution spaces" for addressing this problem:
> - Adding a [new syntax](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/FragmentModularity.md#solution-space-modularity-via-fragment-response-keys) to have fragment names as keys in our existing tree-shaped responses.
> - Creating an [alternative response format](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/FragmentModularity.md#solution-space-new-response-format) that would bring the cost of including fragment information down
> - Adding [metadata to allow clients to know which fragments are fulfilled](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/FragmentModularity.md#solution-space-modularity-via-metadata)
> 
> Personally, I'm of the opinion that the metadata approach is a cudgel: it might give clients some hooks to help solve client-specific problems, but doesn't give us a clear path towards solving other, related problems like Error Boundaries. So I'm more focused on the other two paths: my favored approach would be one where you could safely opt-in to *everything* being modular.
