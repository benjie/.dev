> Following on from #776 and based on the [discussion in the GraphQL.js pull request](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/2861#discussion_r619789288) I'm still uncomfortable with the single root field validation rule for subscription operations.
> 
> Currently the "single root field" algorithm sets `variableValues` to be the empty set and then calls `CollectFields`. To see the issue with this, consider the following subscription operation:
> 
> ```graphql
> type Subscription {
>   mySubscriptionField1: Int
>   mySubscriptionField2: Int
>   mySubscriptionField3: Int
> }
> 
> subscription TwoFieldsByDefault($bool: Boolean = true) {
>   mySubscriptionField1 @skip(if: $bool)
>   mySubscriptionField2 @include(if: $bool)
>   mySubscriptionField3 @include(if: $bool)
> }
> ```
> 
> A call to [CollectFields](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#CollectFields()) passing an empty map for \{variableValues} will result in all selections with `@skip` directives being considered, and all selections with the `@include` directive being skipped. So according to the current validation rule, this operation is valid - it only has one field `mySubscriptionField1` (which is not an introspection field) in the root selection set.
> 
> However, if you pass no variables at runtime, the runtime `CollectFields()` called during [CreateSourceEventStream](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#CreateSourceEventStream()) for the subscription operation will result in `groupedFieldSet` containing two selections (`mySubscriptionField2` and `mySubscriptionField3`). This will result in a request error being raised: `If groupedFieldSet does not have exactly one entry, raise a request error.`
> 
> This catches the invalid operation at runtime rather than validation time, giving a false sense of security about the validity of a GraphQL operation that may fail by default.
> 
> No other validation rule in the entire of Section 5 references `variableValues` or calls `CollectFields`; but we already know that the root subscription selection set is very special (it's been discussed many times at the GraphQL Spec WG).
> 
> This PR proposes that `@skip` and `@include` are forbidden on root subscription selection sets.
> 
> :rotating_light: This is a breaking change since previously valid operations such as the following will now be marked as invalid:
> 
> ```graphql
> subscription ThisIsFineDotJpg($bool: Boolean = true) {
>   mySubscriptionField1 @skip(if: $bool)
>   mySubscriptionField2 @include(if: $bool)
> }
> ```
