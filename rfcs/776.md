I'm writing up some of the GraphQL "query ambiguity" work currently and noticed this issue in the spec. In the case of a subscription it seems that

```graphql
subscription {
  __typename
}
```

does not correctly get evaluated by the reference implementation during subscriptions (though you can query it with `graphql(...)` you can't access it via `subscribe(...)`). It doesn't really make sense to request `__typename` here since it's not ever going to change during the life of the schema, and subscriptions only support one root-level field, however I thought it was worth highlighting.

Reproduction with GraphQL-js (toggle which `doc` is commented to see a functioning subscription):

```js
const {
  GraphQLSchema,
  GraphQLObjectType,
  GraphQLInt,
  GraphQLFloat,
  parse,
  validate,
  subscribe,
} = require("graphql");

const sleep = ms => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));

async function* everySecond() {
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000; i++) {
    yield i;
    await sleep(1000);
  }
}

const Query = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "Query",
  fields: {
    a: {
      type: GraphQLInt,
    },
  },
});

const Subscription = new GraphQLObjectType({
  name: "Subscription",
  fields: {
    ts: {
      type: GraphQLFloat,
      subscribe() {
        return everySecond();
      },
      resolve() {
        return Date.now();
      },
    },
  },
});

const schema = new GraphQLSchema({
  query: Query,
  subscription: Subscription,
});

async function main() {
  const doc = parse("subscription { __typename }");
  // const doc = parse("subscription { ts }");
  const errors = validate(schema, doc);
  if (errors && errors.length) {
    console.dir(errors);
    throw new Error("Errors occurred");
  }
  const result = await subscribe(schema, doc);
  console.dir(result);
  for await (const r of result) {
    console.dir(r);
  }
}

main().catch(e => {
  console.dir(e);
  process.exit(1);
});
```

Produces this error:

```
Error: Subscription field must return Async Iterable. Received: undefined
    at [...]/node_modules/graphql/subscription/subscribe.js:169:13
    at async main ([...]/test.js:57:18)
```
