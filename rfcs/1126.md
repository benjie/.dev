> Currently if `sourceStream` generates an error, then `responseStream` repeats the error. This is the behavior implemented in graphql-js and [is problematic](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/4001).
> 
> GraphQL captures execution errors and wraps them in an `{ errors: [...] }` payload for query and mutation operations; it should do the same for stream errors in a subscription operation.
> 
> This PR makes this behavior explicit.
