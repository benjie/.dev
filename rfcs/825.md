> Follow up of ~~[the @oneField directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/586)~~ and ~~[the Tagged type](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/733)~~.
> 
> **Introducing**: OneOf Input Objects.
> 
> **OneOf Input Objects** are a special variant of Input Objects where the type system asserts that exactly one of the fields must be set and non-null, all others being omitted. This is represented in introspection with the `__Type.isOneOf: Boolean` field, and in SDL via the `@oneOf` directive on the input object.
> 
> This variant of an input object introduces a form of input polymorphism to GraphQL.
> 
> ## Example 1 - `addPet`
> 
> The following `PetInput` oneof input object lets you choose between a number of potential input types:
> 
> ```graphql
> input PetInput @oneOf {
>   cat: CatInput
>   dog: DogInput
>   fish: FishInput
> }
> 
> input CatInput { name: String!, numberOfLives: Int }
> input DogInput { name: String!, wagsTail: Boolean }
> input FishInput { name: String!, bodyLengthInMm: Int }
> 
> type Mutation {
>   addPet(pet: PetInput!): Pet
> }
> ```
> 
> ## Example 2 - `user(by:)`
> 
> Previously you may have had a situation where you had multiple ways to locate a user:
> 
> ```graphql
> type Query {
>   user(id: ID!): User
>   userByEmail(email: String!): User
>   userByUsername(username: String!): User
>   userByRegistrationNumber(registrationNumber: Int!): User
> }
> ```
> 
> with OneOf Input Objects you can now express this via a single field without loss of type safety:
> 
> ```graphql
> input UserBy @oneOf {
>   id: ID
>   email: String
>   username: String
>   registrationNumber: Int
> }
> type Query {
>   user(by: UserBy!): User
> }
> ```
> 
> ## FAQ
> 
> ### Why is this a directive?
> 
> At its core, it's a property of the type that's exposed through introspection - much in the same way that deprecation is. There's nothing in introspection, nor in the types exposed through the reference implementation (`new GraphQLInputObjectType({ name: "...", isOneOf: true, ... })`) that relates to directives. It just happens to be that after [I analysed a number of potential syntaxes](https://gist.github.com/benjie/5e7324c64f42dd818b9c3ac2a91b6b12) (including keywords and alternative syntax) I've found that _when representing the schema as SDL_, using a directive to do so is the least invasive (all current GraphQL parsers can already parse it!) and none of the alternative syntaxes sufficiently justified the increased complexity they would introduce.
> 
> ### Why is this a good approach?
> 
> This approach, as a small change to existing types, is the easiest to adopt of any of the solutions we came up with to the [InputUnion problem](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/rfcs/InputUnion.md). It's also more powerful in that it allows additional types to be part of the "input union" - in fact any valid input type is allowed: input objects, scalars, enums, and lists of the same. Further it can be used on top of existing GraphQL tooling, so it can be adopted much sooner. Finally it's very explicit, so doesn't suffer the issues that "duck typed" input unions could face.
> 
> ### Why did you go full circle via the tagged type?
> 
> When [the @oneField directive](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/586) was proposed some members of the community felt that augmenting the behaviour of existing types might not be the best approach, so the Tagged type was born. (We also researched a lot of other approaches too.) However, the Tagged type brought with it a lot of complexity and controversy, and the Input Unions Working Group decided that we should revisit the simpler approach again. This time around I'm a lot better versed in writing spec edits :grin: 
> 
> ### Why are all the fields nullable? Shouldn't they be non-nullable?
> 
> To make this change minimally invasive I wanted:
> 
> - to make it so that existing GraphQL clients could still validate queries against a oneOf-enabled GraphQL schema (if the fields were non-nullable the clients would think the query was invalid because it didn't supply enough data)
> - to allow existing GraphQL implementations to change as little code as possible
> 
> To accomplish this, we add the "exactly one value, and that value is non-null" as a validation rule that runs after all the existing validation rules - it's an additive change.
> 
> ### Can this allow a field to accept both a scalar and an object?
> 
> Yes!
> 
> ```graphql
> type Query {
>   findUser(by: FindUserBy!): User
> }
> 
> input FindUserBy @oneOf {
>   id: ID
>   organizationAndRegistrationNumber: OrganizationAndRegistrationNumberInput
> }
> 
> input OrganizationAndRegistrationNumberInput {
>   organizationId: ID!
>   registrationNumber: Int!
> }
> ```
> 
> ### Can I use existing GraphQL clients to issue requests to OneOf-enabled schemas?
> 
> Yes - so long as you stick to the rules of one field / one argument manually - note that GraphQL already differentiates between a field not being supplied and a field being supplied with the value `null`.
> 
> Without explicit client support you may lose a little type safety, but all major GraphQL clients can already speak this language. Given this nonsense schema:
> 
> ```graphql
> type Query {
>   foo(by: FooBy!): String
> }
> input FooBy @oneOf {
>   id: ID
>   str1: String
>   str2: String
> }
> ```
> 
> the following are valid queries that you could issue from existing GraphQL clients:
> 
> - `{foo(by:{id: "..."})}`
> - `{foo(by:{str1: "..."})}`
> - `{foo(by:{str2: "..."})}`
> - `query Foo($by: FooBy!) {foo(by: $by)}`
> 
> ### If my input object has only one field, should I use `@oneOf`?
> 
> Doing so would preserve your option value - making a OneOf Input Object into a regular Input Object is a non-breaking change (the reverse is a breaking change). In the case of having one field on your type changing it from oneOf (and nullable) to regular and non-null is a non-breaking change (the reverse is also true in this degenerate case). The two `Example` types below are effectively equivalent - both requireâ€‹ that `value` is supplied with a non-null int:
> 
> ```graphql
> input Example @oneOf {
>   value: Int
> }
> 
> input Example {
>   value: Int!
> }
> ```
> 
> ### Can we expand `@oneOf` to output types to allow for unions of objects, interfaces, scalars, enums and lists; potentially replacing the union type?
