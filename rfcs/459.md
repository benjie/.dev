> This validation requirement was a really nasty breaking change for existing GraphQL type systems. Additionally, it is in my opinion actively harmful to an iterative development model, where you'd define an interface that a field returns, develop on the client against that interface, then days or weeks later, create one or more types that implement the interface, which old clients can start using immediately.
