> This PR is motivated by:
> 
> - #1163 
> 
> In the above PR we want to be able to indicate the error propagation behavior of a schema. However, I find it displeasing that to do so we would need to also explicitly detail the operations supported by the schema when they would normally be auto-detected based on their names:
> 
> ```diff
> +schema @behavior(onError: NO_PROPAGATE) {
> +  query: Query
> +  mutation: Mutation
> +  subscription: Subscription
> +}
> +
>  type Query {
>    q: Int
>  }
> 
>  type Mutation {
>    m: Int
>  }
> 
>  type Subscription {
>    s: Int
>  }
> ```
> 
> This PR makes it so that you can use a schema keyword to add directives and/or description to the schema without needing to also specify the root operation types if they can be inferred by the default naming. The above diff would thus become:
> 
> ```diff
> +schema @behavior(onError: NO_PROPAGATE)
> +
>  type Query {
>    q: Int
>  }
> 
>  type Mutation {
>    m: Int
>  }
> 
>  type Subscription {
>    s: Int
>  }
> ```
> 
> Much nicer! :sparkles: 
> 
> This is also useful without the `onError` feature, since it allows you to apply a description to a schema without having to detail the operations:
> 
> ```diff
> +"""Just an example"""
> +schema
> +
>  type Query {
>    q: Int
>  }
> 
>  type Mutation {
>    m: Int
>  }
> 
>  type Subscription {
>    s: Int
>  }
> ```
> 
> PR #1164 applies these changes onto #1163; but this PR is mergeable into the spec as-is.
