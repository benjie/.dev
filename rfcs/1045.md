> @robrichard raised an issue for `@defer` whereby under the current draft specification if you have this query:
> 
> ```graphql
> query HeroNameQuery {
>   hero {
>     ...NameFragment
>     ...NameFragment @defer
>   }
> }
> fragment NameFragment on Hero {
>   name
> }
> ```
> 
> then the `@defer` will never be visited; but if you move the `@defer` earlier:
> 
> ```graphql
> query HeroNameQuery {
>   hero {
>     ...NameFragment @defer
>     ...NameFragment
>   }
> }
> fragment NameFragment on Hero {
>   name
> }
> ```
> 
> then the non-deferred version will never be visited.

> @mjmahone has an RFC open about [fragment arguments](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/FragmentArguments.md) which suffers a similar issue: visits to a fragment aren't equivalent depending on the variables.
> 
> ```graphql
> query HeroNameQuery {
>   hero {
>     ...ComponentOne
>     ...ComponentTwo
>   }
> }
> fragment ComponentOne on Hero {
>   id
>   ...HeroDetails(includeBio: true, includeAvatar: false)
> }
> fragment ComponentTwo on Hero {
>   ...HeroDetails(includeBio: false, includeAvatar: true)
> }
> fragment HeroDetails($includeBio: Boolean!, $includeAvatar: Boolean!) on Hero {
>   superheroName
>   realName
>   initials
>   ... @include(if: $includeAvatar) {
>     avatarLarge 
>     avatarSmall
>   }
>   ... @include(if: $includeBio) {
>     bioTitle
>     bioSubtitle
>     bioEntryParagraph
>     bioQuote
>     bioMainText
>   }
> }

> Matt's solution takes a Relay-esque approach and generates a key for the fragments based on the values of their arguments.

> Another consideration is where there are user-defined directives; e.g. `{ id ...Profile name ...Profile @live }` might benefit from walking `Profile` again now that it has `@live` attached.
> 
> A simple solution to this is rather than each of these problems having their own solution, to simply navigate the fragment spread again - it's only a single layer that we need to worry about, so the cost is likely to be marginal. This RFC proposes this with a tiny change to the spec - after adding the fragmentSpreadName to visitedFragments, and calling CollectFields, we then remove it again.
