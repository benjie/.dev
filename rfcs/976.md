> It's common in the ecosystem to use `extensions` on a GraphQL request to share additional information with the server; for example Apollo Persisted Queries uses it to indicate the hash of the document to execute.
> 
> Currently the GraphQL Spec specifies an "extensions" field on Response but not on Request; I'm trying to determine if this is a purely transport-level concern (i.e. should be specified in GraphQL-over-HTTP, etc), or if it should be specified in the spec proper. IMO the spec should have _at least_ a note indicating the use of the "extensions" field.
> 
> The specification of the format of a request is somewhat fuzzier than the format of a response; this is not unexpected because GraphQL is so flexible in how it is consumed, and persisted operations/etc should be spec compliant without having to be specified therein. So the request doesn't really speak of _specific keys_, more *here's the information we need to execute*, and "extensions" is not amongst that information. Nonetheless, standardising extensions as a key for expansion would be beneficial to the community.
> 
> It's worth noting that GraphQL.js does not include `extensions` amongst the arguments to `graphql()`: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/blob/699ec58547c34bfeef866a2a4458615d39b16964/src/graphql.ts#L20-L68 . Nor does express-graphql look at `extensions` on a request as far as I can tell.
