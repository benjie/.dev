This proposal directly relates to a discussion in https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/429. As was discussed at the latest WG meeting, I'm creating several alternative proposals. This one implements [proposed solution](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/429#issuecomment-392946579) `3. Limit the validation to only @skip and @include directives`.

It limits the scope of "Directives Are Unique Per Location" to `@skip` and `@include` directives only.

This proposal is mutually exclusive with other alternative proposals:

* [RFC] Limit uniqueness to `@skip`, `@include` and `@deprecated` directives (#471, this one)
* [RFC] Limit directive uniqueness to explicitly marked directives (#472)

@leebyron @IvanGoncharov @jjergus I would appreciate your reviews.

Closes #429
