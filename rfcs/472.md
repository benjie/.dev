This proposal directly relates to a discussion in https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/429. As was discussed at the latest WG meeting, I'm creating several alternative proposals. This one implements [proposed solution](https://github.com/facebook/graphql/issues/429#issuecomment-392946579) `4. Limit the validation to only these directives that are explicitly marked as "unique". This implies that we need to introduce a new option in the directive definition`.

It limits the scope of "Directives Are Unique Per Location" to directives that are explicitly marked as `unique`.

This proposal is mutually exclusive with other alternative proposals:

* [RFC] Limit uniqueness to `@skip`, `@include` and `@deprecated` directives (#471)
* [RFC] Limit directive uniqueness to explicitly marked directives (#472, this one)

@leebyron @IvanGoncharov @jjergus I would appreciate your reviews.

Closes #429
Closes #471
