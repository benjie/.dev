> This formalizes the proprosed feature within `graphql-js` whereby the internal method provided by JavaScript for runtime type resolution is allowed to return an intermediate interface.

> Issue: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/issues/3253
> PR: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3599
> 
> @IvanGoncharov [suggested](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3599#pullrequestreview-1000172471) that this would require​ a spec change. Alternatively, perhaps the recursion [should be considered to be a feature of  the internal system](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/3599#issuecomment-1150257261) itself, possibly limited to JavaScript-like implementations.
> 
> This PR provides some potential spec text, were a spec change to be considered necessary.
