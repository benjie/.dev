I've pulled out the proposed spec edits for Schema Coordinates (issue: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/735) into this PR.

(The RFC now lives in the original PR: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/746/files)

@leebyron you mentioned it might be possible to simplify the grammar - I played around a bit since the original PR, but I think I need some help here. What did you have in mind?

As suggested, tagging @eapache @mjmahone as additional reviewers as we had some good conversation in last WG meeting about this.

Thanks!
