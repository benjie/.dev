Right now the spec says that, for example, if the schema does not define
a mutation root type, then the schema does not support mutations.  But
there's no validation rule for it, which means that many parsers
(including graphql-js) treat a mutation as valid against such a schema.
(Indeed, many end up considering *any* mutation as valid, since they
don't know what type to validate the root selection set against.)  This
commit adds a validation rule to make the schema text explicit.

Slated for discussion at the June 2 working group meeting.
Replaces #947.  See also graphql/graphql-js#3592.
