- [Detailed **security article**](/graphql/security) covering the topics of
  this talk.

  only for personal educational use

:::tip Read the article rather than the slides!

The article includes more details on each of the various validation rules and so
on that I mentioned in the talk. Rather than referencing the slides, reading
the article will likely confer more benefit.
