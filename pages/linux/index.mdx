# Linux

I've been a GNU/Linux user since '99; though most weeks I use all three main
operating systems. I dual-boot
[my PC](https://uk.pcpartpicker.com/user/BenjieGillam/saved/#view=BjtCrH) with
Windows to play PC and especially VR games, but use Linux as my daily driver for
software development and pretty much everything that's not gaming. I also use my
2015 Macbook Pro which is still going strong in 2024; mostly I use it for video
calls with my family, but it's also my work machine when I'm away from home, and
the one you'll see me use for presentations... at least until I find a way of
justifying buying a replacement.

This section of my site is where I mostly keep notes to myself on things that
took some effort to research that I'm likely to need to do again one day.
