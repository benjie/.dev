# Naming conventions

_I rushed this article out a little... Feel free to challenge anything on here
and I'll be happy to add more detail!_

<Pullquote>

CapitalCase/PascalCase was a reserved space for types &mdash; if I see something
in PascalCase I default to assuming it's a type in the schema, if I see
something camelCase I assume it's something other than that. Obviously, the
convention for field names and argument names and variable names is all camel
case. Fragment names are a little bit in an in&ndash;between space there. Made
sense to me to treat them more similarly to a field than more similarly to a
type.

&mdash; _Lee Byron, editor of the GraphQL Specification_

</Pullquote>

This document aims to outline a standard naming conventions for the various
entities that make up a GraphQL schema or executable document, and explain why
the conventions were chosen (and reasons you might consider an alternative).

In general, this guide defers to the conventions used in the GraphQL
Specification (the "Spec").

_Important note: it does not matter what the name used in your underlying
business logic or data storage is, GraphQL is the names that you present to the
world and it should follow conventions that the schema users will find easy to
follow._

For a quick summary, use the table of contents.

<Tldr>

- `UpperCamelCase` for type names.
- `camelCase` for field names, argument names, directive names, operation names,
  variable names, and aliases.
- `CONSTANT_CASE` for enum values.
- Name fragments however you want... but if in doubt, use `camelCase`.

</Tldr>

## Schema

A GraphQL schema defines a number of types of named entities:

- types: scalar, enum, object, interface, union, input object
- enum values
- fields (objects and interfaces)
- input fields (input objects)
- directives
- arguments (fields and directives)

Let's look at naming conventions for each of these in turn.

### Types

There are 6 kind of "type" in GraphQL: `scalar`, `enum`, `type` ("object"),
`interface`, `union` and `input` ("input object"). All these types live in the
same namespace, i.e. if you have a `type` called `Frog` then you cannot also
have an `input` called `Frog`.

The naming conventions for all 6 kinds of "type" in GraphQL tend to be aligned.

#### `Query`, `Mutation`, `Subscription`

["Root operation types"](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sec-Root-Operation-Types)
are special types that are used as the type of the `query`, `mutation` and
`subscription` operations. You should name these `Query`, `Mutation` and
`Subscription` respectively so you don't need to declare the supported
operations/types via the `schema` keyword.

#### UpperCamelCase

The root operation types already use this naming convention, and it's used
throughout the Spec. Seems uncontroversial.

#### Singular

If you have a type that represents a person, the type should be called something
like `Person`. It should not be called `People`. There are no plural type names
in the Spec.

#### Prefix: none

GraphQL types should not be prefixed, for example an interface representing
"media" would be called `Media`, **not** `IMedia`.

#### Suffix: mostly none

In general GraphQL types should not have suffixes, for example a custom scalar
representing a UUID would be called `UUID`, **not** `UUIDScalar`. One exception
to this is input object types...

#### Suffixes for `input`s

At time of writing the Spec includes the following non-placeholder `input`s in
examples:

- `input Point`
- `input Point2D`
- `input FindDogInput`

In real-world schemas it's rare to find input objects that don't have a suffix;
this is because it's very common for an `input` to have an associated `type`,
and these types cannot use the same name. Generally the `type` will use the
"base name" (e.g. `Point`) and the input will use a derived name that has a
suffix, for example `PointInput`, `PointPatch` or similar.

Common suffixes used for input objects are:

- `Input` - generally used for the input version of an output type (e.g. for a
  "create" or "upsert" mutation)
- `Patch` or `Update` (Benjie prefers "Patch") - generally used when applying an
  update to an output type, typically all of the fields are nullable so that you
  can choose to only update the fields you specify (e.g. for an "update"
  mutation)
- `Filter` - generally used to specify how to filter a collection
- `Order` - generally used for ordering (sorting) a collection

### Enum values

#### CONSTANT_CASE

Reason: the Spec, PostGraphile API, GitHub API

### Fields (objects and interfaces)

#### camelCase

Reason: the Spec, PostGraphile API, GitHub API

### Input fields (input objects)

Generally the same as object fields.

#### camelCase

Reason: the Spec, PostGraphile API, GitHub API

### Directives

#### camelCase

The built in directives `@skip` and `@include` could be camelCase or even
snake_case; but we discussed this at the GraphQL WG regarding the `@oneOf`
directive and it was decided that we would use camelCase going forward.

Reason: the (future) Spec

### Arguments (fields and directives)

#### camelCase

Reason: the Spec

## Executable documents

A GraphQL "executable document" (the document in a GraphQL request, often
imprecisely referred to as a "query") generally uses the names defined in the
schema, but it also defines a number of types of named entities:

- operation names
- fragment names
- aliases

### Operation names

e.g. in the Spec one example document is `query getDogName { dog { name } }`;
the operation name in this is `getDogName`. Operation names are optional.

#### camelCase

The Spec uses a mixture of `camelCase` and `UpperCamelCase` for operation names,
but there are significantly more examples using `camelCase` than
`UpperCamelCase`, so that's what we recommend.

Reason: the Spec

### Fragments

One [example](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#example-80138) in the Spec:

```graphql
fragment userFragment on User {
  friends {
    count
  }
}
```

#### camelCase (or whatever)

This one is a little controversial.

In the April 20th 2023 Spec WG [I asked Lee](https://youtu.be/Dk7zQA0bUVc?t=539)
why camelCase was generally used in the spec for naming fragments. Lee said:

There's actually a mixture of naming for fragments in the spec, some use
UpperCamelCase but the majority use camelCase.

It's worth noting that Relay requires that fragment names start with the name of
the file in which they're defined.

You should use whatever your team wants to use; but if in doubt then the spec
leans towards camelCase.

Reason: the Spec.

### Aliases

#### camelCase

Aliases are just different names for fields, generally they should use the same
naming convention as fields unless you have a good reason (e.g. you're trying to
match some external data format).

#### Short

Aliases have three main purposes:

1. Abbreviating long field names (e.g. `fullName` -> `name`)
2. Allowing you to reference the same field twice with different parameters
   (e.g. `smallPic: profilePic(size: 64), bigPic: profilePic(size: 1024)`)
3. Clarifying intent (e.g. `nodes` -> `people`)

In all cases, the alias you use should be short. Using too many aliases, or
aliases that are too long, may trigger a server's security protections.

## Extra research

### Example schema

The Spec contains
[this example schema](https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#example-8b4ff):

```graphql
type Query {
  dog: Dog
  findDog(searchBy: FindDogInput): Dog
}

enum DogCommand {
  SIT
  DOWN
  HEEL
}

type Dog implements Pet {
  name: String!
  nickname: String
  barkVolume: Int
  doesKnowCommand(dogCommand: DogCommand!): Boolean!
  isHouseTrained(atOtherHomes: Boolean): Boolean!
  owner: Human
}

interface Sentient {
  name: String!
}

interface Pet {
  name: String!
}

type Alien implements Sentient {
  name: String!
  homePlanet: String
}

type Human implements Sentient {
  name: String!
  pets: [Pet!]
}

enum CatCommand {
  JUMP
}

type Cat implements Pet {
  name: String!
  nickname: String
  doesKnowCommand(catCommand: CatCommand!): Boolean!
  meowVolume: Int
}

union CatOrDog = Cat | Dog
union DogOrHuman = Dog | Human
union HumanOrAlien = Human | Alien

input FindDogInput {
  name: String
  owner: String
}
```
