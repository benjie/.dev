# Graph Traversal

<Tldr>

The 'Graph' in 'GraphQL' relates to traversing the graph of your data model. The
value of a node in a graph is independent of the path through which it was
fetched.

</Tldr>

The 'Graph' in 'GraphQL' comes from, originally, Facebook thinking of their data
in terms of a graph:

## Graph overview

In a mathematical graph, there are "nodes" and "edges". The nodes are generally
the entities (users, pages, posts, photos, etc), and the edges are the
relationships between those entities (likes, tagged, photo, friend, etc). Both
nodes and edges may contain data, for example, an edge might show that Bob is a
friend of Alice, and it can contain additional information such as the duration
of that friendship.

When traversing a mathematical graph, you can start at a node (or set of nodes)
and then follow the edges to discover new nodes. Let's imagine your name is
'Current Viewer' and this is a portion of your social graph:

```mermaid
%%{init: {'themeVariables': { 'edgeLabelBackground': 'white'}}}%%
flowchart TD
  Viewer{{"Current Viewer"}}:::start -- "likes" --> Discworld(["Discworld"])
  Viewer -- "friend" --> Alice["Aveline<br/>Gearhart"]
  Viewer -- "friend" ---> Bob["Lil'<br>Bobby"]
  Alice -- "friend" -->  Bob
  Alice -- "friend" --> Carl["Carlos<br>Gonzales"]
  Alice -- "likes" --> SteamPunk
  Viewer -- "likes" --> SteamPunk(["Steam Punk"])
  Bob -- "likes" --> SQLI(["SQL Injection"])
  Bob -- "likes" --> Conferences(["Conferences"])
  Bob -. "friend" .-> Blank2["&nbsp;"]:::blank
  Carl -. "friend" .-> Blank2["&nbsp;"]:::blank
  Carl -. "friend" .-> Blank3["&nbsp;"]:::blank
  Carl -. "likes" .-> Blank4(["&nbsp;"]):::blank

  classDef start fill:#ffffff,stroke-width:4,stroke:black,font-weight:bold
  classDef page fill:#eeccee
  classDef blank fill:transparent,stroke-dasharray:5 5,width:6rem
  class Discworld,Conferences,SteamPunk,SQLI,Blank4 page

  linkStyle 2 color:blue,stroke:blue,stroke-width:4
  linkStyle 1,3 color:#DC3220,stroke:#DC3220,stroke-width:4
```

To get to Lil' Bobby you could traverse `friend` directly (**<span
style={{color:"blue"}}>blue</span>**), or you could traverse `friend>friend` to
go via Aveline Gearhart (**<span style={{color:"#DC3220"}}>red</span>**). Note
that independent of which path you take to get to Lil' Bobby, their likes are
always the same: SQL Injection and Conferences.

This property turns out to be really important if you want to ensure the web
page is always rendered consistently even when only doing small data fetches by
using a storage technique we call [normalized stores](/graphql/normalized).
