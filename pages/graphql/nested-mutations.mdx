# "GraphQL" Nested Mutations

### <span style={{fontSize: "8rem"}}>ðŸ›‘ NO! â›”</span>

<Pullquote>

a schema using "nested mutations" **is not a GraphQL schema**

</Pullquote>

"Nested mutations" is the practice of performing side-effects in child fields of
the mutation fields. This is explicitly forbidden by the GraphQL spec:

> the resolution of fields other than top-level mutation fields must always be
> side effect-free and idempotent
>
> &mdash; https://spec.graphql.org/draft/#sel-GANRNDABiEBuHxyV

Therefore, a schema using "nested mutations" **is not a GraphQL schema** &mdash;
it does not comply with the GraphQL specification.

There's a number of reasons for this, but the most convincing one for me is that
GraphQL is client-focussed and it's important for clients to have a mental model
of what the server will do. If the server might perform mutations/side-effects
anywhere then the client can't safely cache anything. However, if the client
knows that mutations/side-effects only happen in specific locations (currently
only in root-level mutation fields) then it can use this knowledge to factor
into its caching and re-rendering strategies.

There are some RFCs proposed to address some of the desires behind nested
mutations:

- [Serial fields](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/252)
- [Namespaces](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/163)

:::info

The term "nested mutations" has also been used by some people to describe the
practice where a single mutation field accepts as input a nested tree of
(possibly lists of) input objects which define the mutations to occur. All
mutations still happen within this single root-level Mutation field, and thus
this pattern _is_ valid GraphQL (and is not the subject of this article).

A better name for this pattern might be "mutation" or "mutation with nested
input objects".
