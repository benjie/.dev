# Referencing Ancestors

<Tldr>

GraphQL's execution model does not give you a native way to reference ancestors
in field resolvers (only the entity itself is provided), and that's for good
reason: GraphQL mimics [traversing a graph](./traversal.mdx). The value of a
node in the graph is independent of the path you took to get to it; breaking
this rule would break technology that relies on it, for example
[normalized stores](./normalized.mdx).

</Tldr>

One of the common requests that I see in GraphQL is users wanting a way to query
an ancestor object from a descendant object. Throughout this article, I'm going
to use an example based on the one given in
[GraphQL spec issue #144](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/144#issue-133595212);
here's the schema under discussion:

```graphql
type Query {
  events: [Event]
}

type Event {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  speakers: [Speaker]
  talks: [Talk]
}

type Speaker {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  events: [Event]
  talks: [Talk]
}

type Talk {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  speaker: Speaker
  event: Event
}
```

Consider this query:

```graphql
query {
  events {
    id
    name
    speakers {
      id
      name
      talks {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The issue author would like to make it such that `>events>speakers>talks` (using
[operation expressions](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/OperationExpressions.md)
syntax) returns the list of talks that the speaker has in the ancestor event.

At first glance, this might seem like a reasonable proposition... However, when
considering [graph traversal](./traversal.mdx) it becomes apparent why this
would be problematic &mdash; the value of a `Speaker`'s `talks` field should be
independent of the path through which it was accessed. In particular,
[normalized stores](./normalized.mdx) rely on the graph traversal execution
behaviour outlined in the GraphQL specification; to change this fundamental
behaviour could cause applications using normalized stores to produce subtle
issues resulting in a lot of confusion and frustration.

## Breaks normalized stores

Let's see why normalized stores would be broken by this. If you implement the
described change, you might get a result from the request above such as:

```json {7-15,23-32}
{
  "events": [
    {
      "id": "EGQLC",
      "name": "GraphQLConf",
      "speakers": [
        {
          "id": "UB3NJ",
          "name": "Benjie",
          "talks": [
            {
              "id": "TGFST",
              "name": "The Future of Efficiency Is Here: Schema Planning"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "EVRGU",
      "name": "VR Gamers",
      "speakers": [
        {
          "id": "UB3NJ",
          "name": "Benjie",
          "talks": [
            {
              "id": "TPOPC",
              "name": "Mastering Climbing in Population:One"
            }
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

(I've omitted all other speakers and all other events for brevity.)

When you [turn this into a normalized store](./normalized.mdx), both events
reference the speaker `UB3NJ`, who has a field `talks` that accepts no
arguments; so when you merge these, the latter will overwrite the former, and
the resulting store will end up being something like:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```json5 {18-30}
{
  "Query": {
    "events": [ { "$ref": "EGQLC" }, { "$ref": "EVRGU" } ]
  }
  "EGQLC": {
    "id": "EGQLC",
    "name": "GraphQLConf",
    "speakers": [ { "$ref": "UB3NJ" } ]
  },
  "EVRGU": {
    "id": "EVRGU",
    "name": "VR Gamers",
    "speakers": [ { "$ref": "UB3NJ" } ]
  },
  "UB3NJ": {
    "id": "UB3NJ",
    "name": "Benjie",
    /* This gets overwritten:
    "talks": [
      {
        "id": "TGFST",
        "name": "The Future of Efficiency Is Here: Schema Planning"
      }
    ] */
    "talks": [
      {
        "id": "TPOPC",
        "name": "Mastering Climbing in Population:One"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

When you reconstitute this back into data to render you'll end up with Benjie's
talk for the "VR Gamers" event being used for GraphQLConf... A subtle issue when
testing the software (very hard to notice) but super obvious to the attendees of
GraphQLConf who wonder how relevant "Mastering Climbing in Population:One" is to
GraphQL!

## Solution: rewrite the query

One solution to this problem is to write your query in such a way that each
field can execute in a context-free way and still give you the data you need:

```graphql
query {
  events {
    id
    name
    talks {
      id
      name
      speakers {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Solution: add another field

Another solution is to perform the grouping on the server side and expose this
via the schema:

```graphql
extend type Event {
  speakersAndTalks: [SpeakerAndTalks]
}
type SpeakerAndTalks {
  speaker: Speaker
  talks: [Talk]
}
```

which you could query like this:

```graphql
query {
  events {
    id
    name
    speakersAndTalks {
      speaker {
        id
        name
      }
      talks {
        id
        name
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Thank you to fellow TSC member [Matt Mahoney](https://github.com/mjmahone) for
proof-reading this article. Matt comments that this can also occur in:

> REST-based resolvers, where the `events.speaker` field is backed by a REST
> endpoint, which always gives you `Speaker.talks` in a context-dependent way.
