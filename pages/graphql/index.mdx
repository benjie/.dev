# GraphQL

#### Check out the :point_right: [GraphQL Spec RFC tracker!](/rfcs) :point_left:

I love GraphQL, so much I named my community-funded open-source company for my
love of it: [Graphile](https://graphile.org)! I first became involved with
GraphQL via the PostGraphQL project (renamed to
[PostGraphile](https://postgraphile.org) after I became the maintainer), joined
and became [heavily involved
in](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/graphs/contributors) the GraphQL
Working Group, [authored a number of spec
changes](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/graphs/contributors), became a
member of the [GraphQL Technical Steering
Committee](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/GraphQL-TSC.md#tsc-members),
and have even written a [cutting edge planning and execution engine for
GraphQL: Gra*fast*!](https://grafast.org) It's fair to say I know GraphQL
pretty well at this point...

In the following articles, I'd like to share with you what I _personally_
believe are best practices and important lessons about GraphQL. These are my
opinions, but I try to back them up with evidence or reasoning where possible.

First: **you should probably be using [Trusted Documents...](./trusted-documents.mdx)**
