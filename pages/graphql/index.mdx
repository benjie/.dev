# GraphQL

I love GraphQL, so much I named my community-funded open-source company for my
love of it: [Graphile](https://graphile.org)!

Since I started getting involved in GraphQL, first with the PostGraphQL project
(later renamed to PostGraphile) and then with the GraphQL Working Group itself,
I've become more and more familiar with both GraphQL the technology, and with
the ways that people use it.

I'm now a member of the GraphQL Technical Steering Committee, and also the #2
contributor to the GraphQL specification itself, so though my British nature
makes me feel really uncomfortable saying it, you could class me as a GraphQL
expert.

In the following articles, I'd like to share with you what I _personally_
believe are best practices and important lessons about GraphQL. These are my
opinions, but I try to back them up with evidence or reasoning where possible.

First: you should probably be using [Trusted Documents...](./trusted-documents.mdx).
