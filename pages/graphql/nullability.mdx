### By default, data doesn't exist

In mathematics and in many programming languages we use `null` to represent data
that doesn't exist (let's not get into JavaScript...).

The original SQL standard factored this knowledge into its design, so an `int`
column in SQL means "an integer or null". To represent a non-nullable integer
you would add a type narrowing constraint, such as `int not null`. This pattern
of the type including null unless otherwise constrained is called "**nullable by
default**".

GraphQL is similar, types are nullable by default. To narrow a type to exclude
null, we add a "non null" wrapper, indicated in the GraphQL language by an
exclamation point:

```graphql title="Initial schema"
type User {
  name: String! # Definitely a string, never null
}

type Query {
  you: User! # Definitely a User, never null
}
```

### Partial success

Resiliency was a key design goal of GraphQL. When working on the newsfeed,
Facebook wanted to ensure that any temporary interruptions in one part of the
system would not impact on other parts and cause user outages. Instead, they
wanted GraphQL to enable "partial success" where as much data as possible would
be rendered to the user.

To enable this resiliency, when GraphQL meets an error it notes where it was,
adds it to the "errors" list, and replaces the output data with `null`:

```graphql title="Query type"
type Query {
  you: User!
  me: User
}
```

```graphql title="Query"
query Q {
  you {
    name
  }
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "data": {
    "you": {
      "name": "Jo"
    },
    "me": null // < An error occurred, see `errors`
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": ["me"],
      "message": "Not logged in"
    }
  ]
}
```

But what if a non-null field errors? If we placed a null in that position,
wouldn't that be a contradiction?

```graphql title="Query type"
type Query {
  you: User!
  me: User! # How does non-null interact with errors?
}
```

### Error propagation (aka null bubbling)

To keep the non-null promise, GraphQL decided to perform a behavior it terms
"error propagation" but most people refer to as "null bubbling" - it would throw
the error and catch it at the next nullable position (or the operation root if
no such position existed).

The end result: GraphQL will destroy result data outside of the field that
failed in order to keep non-null promises. No wonder Facebook call the non-null
type "**kills parent on exception**"!

```json title="Response"
{
  "data": null,
  //     üëÜ All of the data was destroyed, even the unrelated `you` field!
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": ["me"],
      "message": "Not logged in"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Schema best practice?

So when designing schemas it has been best practice to make fields nullable
unless we're fairly certain they won't error. This allows the client to retain
its resilience to errors, by rendering partially successful data.

But having null checks throughout our client sucks!

```tsx
if (data.me) {
  return <User user={data.me} />;
} else {
  // TODO: determine if this was an error null,
  // or just a non-existant user.
  return <NotFoundOrError />;
}
```

### Handling errors on the client

[`graphql-toe`](https://github.com/graphile/graphql-toe) is an npm module that
uses getters to reproduce server errors on the client by throwing when an
errored field is accessed:

```ts
import { toe } from "graphql-toe";
import { gql, request } from "graffle";

const response = await request("/graphql", document);
const dataAndErrors = toe(response);

dataAndErrors.you; // Returns {"name": "Jo"}
dataAndErrors.me; // ‚ÄºÔ∏è throws Error("Log in!") ‚ÄºÔ∏è
```

`graphql-toe` can be integrated into many frameworks in the JS ecosystem (Apollo
Client, urql, graffle, `fetch()`), but other frameworks may have their own
native error handling (e.g. Relay has the
[`@throwOnFieldError` directive](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/throw-on-field-error-directive/)
which can be applied to fragments).

By recombining `errors` back into `data` we no longer need GraphQL to bubble
nulls to keep its promise; since a `null` can never be read from an errored
position.

We call clients that handle errors in this way "error-handling clients".

:::tip Error-handling clients are the future

Handling errors in this way allows your developers to use traditional error
handling mechanisms to handle errors, whether that be `try`/`catch` or
`<ErrorBoundary />` or whatever your language or framework supports.

You can likely make your existing client an error-handling client today by
integrating `graphql-toe`, it's only 512 bytes gzipped! (You can also just
integrate the source code, it's less than 100 LOC in TypeScript and is MIT
licensed.)

:::

### Disabling error propagation and reflecting true nullability

So, if the client were to take responsibility for error handling by disabling
null bubbling and implementing a "throw on error" or similar behavior, we could
reflect the data's true nullability in the schema:

```graphql title="Query type"
type Query {
  you: User!
  me: User! # True nullability; client handles errors
}
```

Hooray for fewer null checks!

```tsx title="Before üòû"
if (data.me) {
  return <User user={data.me} />;
} else {
  // TODO: determine if this was an error null,
  // or just a non-existant user.
  return <NotFoundOrError />;
}
```

```tsx title="After ü§©"
return <User user={data.me} />;
```

:::tip Try it today!

Some GraphQL engines already support clients disabling error propagation via the
`@experimental_disableErrorPropagation` operation directive!

:::

### Supporting legacy clients

But what does this mean for our existing deployed applications, for example
mobile apps on legacy devices that can no longer be updated? This is certainly a
critical concern for organizations such as Facebook!

If we introduce non-null in more places, this would have the effect of making
existing deployed applications less resilient to errors since errors will now
destroy even more of the returned data. For example, an application such as this
one that handles errors at the widget level:

<img
  alt="A legacy mobile application rendering many widgets, one of which has errored"
  src={LegacyAppWidgetError}
  style={{ maxWidth: "250px" }}
/>

might result in a full page error if we simply marked the type as non-nullable:

<img
  alt="A legacy mobile application rendering a full-page error"
  src={LegacyAppFullscreenError}
  style={{ maxWidth: "250px" }}
/>

_(Thanks to v0 for generating these app mockups for me!)_

### The "transitional non-null" type

To support these legacy apps, I propose a "**transitional** non-null" type,
represented by the wildcard symbol `*`, that changes to either be nullable (`T*`
&rArr; `T`) for legacy apps (those with error propagation enabled) or
non-nullable (`T*` &rArr; `T!`) for our future "error handling clients".

<img
  alt="Legacy and future apps side by side, handling errors gracefully thanks to transitional non-null type"
  src={EveryonesHappy}
  style={{ maxWidth: "500px" }}
/>

:::tip Use `graphql-sock` to convert these types

`graphql-sock` is an npm module that provides a CLI capable of converting a
"semantic nullability" schema (that is to say one that supports the "semantic
non null" aka "transitional non null" type) into a schema with traditional
syntax, either by removing the semantic non-nullability for legacy clients
(`semantic-to-nullable`) or by replacing transitional/semantic non-null with the
traditional (strict) non-null for error-handling clients (`semantic-to-strict`).

Use it today to support both your legacy (`semantic-to-nullable`) and
error-handling (`semantic-to-strict`) applications' codegen and similar needs.

:::

### New app? No new syntax!

The best part about this? If you're starting a new project from scratch and only
want to support error-handling clients, you'll never need to add this symbol to
your schema or anywhere else! But with it, existing schemas can allow new apps
to leverage true nullability in the schema, without breaking existing clients.
Everybody wins!

### Current status - disabling error propagation

_Last updated: 2025-03-26_

Generally agreed that the future of GraphQL in one in which error propagation
is disabled. The mechanics of it, particularly recognising that we need to
support legacy clients, are still under discussion.

- Originally proposed as a directive
  ([spec edits](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1050)) - currently
  `@disableErrorPropagation`
- Currently, Benjie proposes this should be a request (in the GraphQL sense, not
  necessarily the HTTP sense) parameter:
  https://github.com/graphql/nullability-wg/discussions/86
- There's discussion around whether clients that reject the entire response on
  any error should get their own "behavior", e.g. `@behavior(onError: ABORT)` -
  this would increase server efficiency, and prevent sending unnecessary data
  over the wire that the client would ignore anyway.

The `@experimental_disableErrorPropagation` directive can be used to experiment
with disabling error propagation without any further impact, and will be
available in the next releases of:

- [graphql-js](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4348)
- [graphql-java](https://github.com/graphql-java/graphql-java/pull/3772)


### Current status - semantic nullability

**THIS IS BENJIE'S OPINION, FOR TRUE STATUS SEE
[THE RFC DOCUMENT](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/SemanticNullability.md)!**

_Last updated: 2025-03-26_


#### Specification

To deal with the legacy clients problem, the working group has generally
solidified around the concept of a "semantic non-nullable" type that can be
thought of as "null only on error" - i.e. it will never be `null` unless an
error has occurred (and been noted in the `"errors"` list).

However, how this is presented via the SDL is under heavy discussion. There are
currently
[6 solutions](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-wg/blob/main/rfcs/SemanticNullability.md#-possible-solutions)
being discussed.

1.  **Semantic non-null, represented by `*`**

    - **Champion**: Benjie
    - **Status**: Preferred by Benjie, outdated.
    - **Spec edits**: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/pull/1065
    - **Reference implementation**:
      https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4192 - available via
      `graphql@canary-pr-4192`
    - An outdated version of what is proposed above.
    - **TODO**: update this!

2.  **Strict Semantic Nullability**

    - **Champion**: Lee Byron
    - **Status**: Rejected by Lee
    - **Spec edits**: none
    - **Reference implementation**: none
    - This proposal choose to break the "nullable by default" tradition in
      favour of representing nullable with a `?`: nullable (`T?`), semantically
      non-nullable (`T`) and strictly non-nullable (`T!`)strictly non-nullable
      (`T!`), and does so by introducing a directive on the schema to indicate
      this.
    - Benjie believes it's non-viable for a number of reasons, chiefly that it
      doesn't consider what it means for executable documents (how do clients
      define variables?), and none of the three solutions to executable
      documents seem desirable.

3.  **Semantic non-null usurps `!` syntax, strict non-null uses `!!`**

    - **Champion**: Benjie
    - **Status**: On hold, since solution 1 is currently preferred by Benjie.
    - **Spec edits**: none
    - **Reference implementation**: none
    - This was a derivative of solution 1 to attempt to address concerns that
      the `*` syntax was non-obvious.
    - It requires a document directive to opt in to the new syntax (otherwise
      `!` will continue to mean strict non-null).
    - Client documents need not change.
    - It recognises the two modes laid out in this article, but tries to move
      towards a future where every schema only uses semantically non-null types,
      and the legacy strict non-null is phased out.
    - Benjie doesn't currently prefer this because he agrees with solution 5 -
      the future of GraphQL uses its current syntax, and doesn't need a
      `"use strict"`-style pragma at the top of every document.

4.  **Unadorned becomes semantic non-null, nullable represented by `?`**

    - **Champion**: None (currently Alex Reilly is representing)
    - **Status**: Unknown
    - **Spec edits**: none
    - **Reference implementation**:
      https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/4337
    - This is an expansion of solution 2 that moves the directive from the
      schema to the document.
    - Benjie dislikes it because:
      - Data is nullable by default, but this makes data semantically
        non-nullable by default.
      - The unadorned type cannot be migrated to other types (specifically the
        `T?` nullable type) in a non-breaking way, so schema authors will have
        to be extra careful that they have remembered to mark up every type
        correctly - they can't fix it later by adding a symbol.
      - If `?` means nullable in the SDL and unadorned means non-nullable, what
        does this mean for existing executable documents where unadorned means
        nullable?
        - Should executable documents use `@semanticNullability` and use
          `?`/unadorned, or should they continue to use unadorned/`!`?
        - Will this cause a split in the GraphQL ecosystem over best practices
          around this?
      - Having the meaning of unadorned suddenly mean the opposite of what it
        did before (nullable &rArr; non-nullable) based on the presence of a
        directive at the top of the document is super confusing.
      - Spec implementation is complex.
      - Reference implementation is complex.
      - Updating all the "nullable by default" documentation across the last
        decade for GraphQL is not desirable.
      - Newbies to GraphQL will be super confused.
      - I think this would be one of the worst possible moves that GraphQL could
        make.
      - I would much rather see a "GraphQL 2.0" that disables null bubbling
        (and, if you like, gets rid of the `!` syntax in favour of `?`) than see
        GraphQL enter this state.
      - _Increasingly incoherent "old man yells at cloud" noises._

5.  **Just use `!` for semantically non-nullable**

    - **Champion**: Martin Bonnin
    - **Status**: Actively proposed
    - **Spec edits**: no action needed!
    - **Reference implementation**: no action needed!
    - Martin thinks we should just use the existing non-null in semantically
      non-nullable places, relying on the ability to disable error propagation
      for all future clients.
    - This proposal is extremely compelling, it feels like it should be the
      future of GraphQL, and it recognises that error propagation was probably a
      mistake and just turning that off should be enough to fix our woes.
    - Unfortunately, as laid out [above](#supporting-legacy-clients), this would
      be a major shift in behavior for existing deployed clients resulting in
      error boundaries moving towards the root of the operation, causing legacy
      clients that cannot be updated to be less resilient to errors.
    - This sparked Benjie's reframing of solution 1 as presented in this
      article.

6.  **`@semanticNonNull` directive**
    - **Champion**: None (the nullability WG designed this together as an
      interrim solution)
    - **Status**: Interrim solution, implemented in a number of runtimes
    - **Spec edits**: None (though solution 1 could be changed to doing this
      with very few edits)
    - **Reference implementation**: None (though solution 1 could be changed to
      doing this with very few edits)
    - **Community spec**:
      https://specs.apollo.dev/nullability/v0.4/#@semanticNonNull
    - Essentially this is solution 1, but instead of introducing a `*` character
      (e.g. `[T*]*`) we use a directive to indicate semantic nullability
      (`[T] @semanticNonNull(levels: [0, 1])`)
    - Does everything that solution 1 does, except for the convenient syntax.
    - Directives already exist, so we don't need to debate syntax!
    - Benjie's opinion:
      - Given this is essentially solution 1 but without the syntax changes, I
        support it...
      - Do we really hate `*` syntax so much that we'd rather type
        `@semanticNonNull(levels: [0, 1])` than adding two `*` characters?
      - I currently see this as being implemented in the same way as solution 1;
        **however**, it could be implemented as schema metadata and thus never
        actually enter the specification.
        - It needs support in both server and client, so it feels like it should
          be part of the spec.
        - Keeping it as schema metadata would require a solution to the infamous
          [#300](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/issues/300)

#### Server support

Users can manually mark up schemas with `@semanticNonNull` for use by
`graphql-sock`, `graphql-code-generator` and other tools.

Native support for semantic nullability is available in the following GraphQL
implementations:

- `graphql@canary-pr-4192` has support for the `*` syntax for semantic nullability
- Grats has support for `@semanticNonNull` in [v0.0.32](https://grats.capt.dev/docs/guides/strict-semantic-nullability/)
- Hot Chocolate has support for `@semanticNonNull` as of [v14.2.0](https://github.com/ChilliCream/graphql-platform/releases/tag/14.2.0)

#### Client support

Most clients can become error-handling clients by integrating
[`graphql-toe`](https://github.com/graphile/graphql-toe).

- Graffle, fetch, and other simple clients have examples in the graphql-toe
  `README`
- Apollo Client has an example of `useTOEQuery()` (to replace `useQuery()`) in
  the graphql-toe `README`
- URQL has `@urql/exchange-throw-on-error` that integrates `graphql-toe`
- Relay users should use `@throwOnFieldError` instead
- Apollo Kotlin has native support for `@catch`

Most clients can use [`graphql-sock`](https://github.com/graphile/graphql-sock)
to convert a semantic nullability schema into a nullable
(`semantic-to-nullable`) schema for legacy clients, or a strict
(`semantic-to-strict`) schema for error handling clients, for the purposes of
code generation, linting, and other needs.

- GraphQL code generator has support for `@semanticNonNull` (any version) and
  the `*` syntax (if you're using `graphql@canary-pr-4192`) in the
  [latest alpha](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/pull/10323)
  via `graphql-sock`.
- Relay has built in support for code generation respecting semantic nullability
  on a per-fragment and per-field basis as of Relay v18 via the `@catch` and
  `@throwOnFieldError` directives.
- Apollo Kotlin's code generator has native support for `@semanticNonNull` and `@catch`
