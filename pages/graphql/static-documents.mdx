# Static vs Dynamic Documents

<Tldr>

**Do not generate GraphQL documents dynamically**, instead write reusable
documents and supply variables at runtime to safely specify dynamic parameters.

</Tldr>

## ðŸš« Dynamic documents

Typically, dynamic documents are generated at runtime through string
concatenation or AST manipulation. For example:

```js
query = "query GetUser { user(id: "
query += userId
query += ") { name"
if (showAvatar) {
  query += " avatarUrl"
}
query += " } }"
```

This technique has a lot of drawbacks:

- Potentially infinite documents issued to server.
- Server must validate each new document.
- Hard to analyze/lint with common tooling (e.g.
  [`graphql-eslint`](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/eslint/docs) or
  [`gqlcheck`](https://github.com/graphile/gqlcheck)).
- Cannot easily validate; needs thorough testing.
- Vulnerable to GraphQL injection.

## âœ… Static documents

With static documents you write reusable documents such as:

```js
query = `
  query GetUser(
    $userId: Int!
    $showAvatar: Boolean! = false
  ) {
    user(id: $userId) {
      name
      avatarUrl @include(if: $showAvatar)
    }
  }
`
```

And then you supply variables at run-time to populate the placeholders:

```js
variables = { userId, showAvatar }
```

This has a lot of advantages:

- Syntax highlighting and auto-complete directly in your editor (when supported).
- Easy to copy/paste into GraphiQL or similar IDE for debugging.
- Easy to use with standard GraphQL tooling such as linting.
- Not vulnerable to GraphQL injection.
- Validate each document once, no need to re-check when the variable values change.
- Supports ["trusted documents"](./trusted-documents.mdx) security feature.
- Can check validity at build time - remove need for runtime validation.
- Easy to track which fields are in use.
- Server can optimize known queries.

You should always use static documents unless there's a very good reason not to.

## Other terms

**Ad-hoc documents** are those written on the fly, generally by a human.
