## The status quo

:::tip Already familiar with GraphQL's error handling?

‚è© Jump to [Handling errors on the client](#handling-errors-on-the-client) for the
proposed changes to GraphQL.

:::

### By default, data doesn't exist

In mathematics and in many programming languages we use `null` to represent data
that doesn't exist (let's not get into JavaScript...).

The original SQL standard factored this knowledge into its design, so an `int`
column in SQL means "an integer or null". To represent a non-nullable integer
you would add a type narrowing constraint, such as `int not null`. This pattern
of the type including null unless otherwise constrained is called "**nullable by
default**".

GraphQL is similar, types are nullable by default. To narrow a type to exclude
null, we add a "non null" wrapper, indicated in the GraphQL language by an
exclamation point:

```graphql title="Initial schema"
type User {
  name: String! # Definitely a string, never null
}

type Query {
  you: User! # Definitely a User, never null
}
```

### Partial success

Resiliency was a key design goal of GraphQL. When working on the newsfeed,
Facebook wanted to ensure that any temporary interruptions in one part of the
system would not impact on other parts and cause user outages. Instead, they
wanted GraphQL to enable "partial success" where as much data as possible would
be rendered to the user.

To enable this resiliency, when GraphQL meets an error it notes where it was,
adds it to the "errors" list, and replaces the output data with `null`:

```graphql title="Query type"
type Query {
  you: User!
  me: User
}
```

```graphql title="Query"
query Q {
  you {
    name
  }
  me {
    name
  }
}
```

```json title="Response"
{
  "data": {
    "you": {
      "name": "Jo"
    },
    "me": null // < An error occurred, see `errors`
  },
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": ["me"],
      "message": "Not logged in"
    }
  ]
}
```

But what if a non-null field errors? If we placed a null in that position,
wouldn't that be a contradiction?

```graphql title="Query type"
type Query {
  you: User!
  me: User! # How does non-null interact with errors?
}
```

### Error propagation (aka null bubbling)

To keep the non-null promise, GraphQL decided to perform a behavior it terms
"error propagation" but most people refer to as "null bubbling" - it would throw
the error and catch it at the next nullable position (or the operation root if
no such position existed).

The end result: GraphQL will destroy result data outside of the field that
failed in order to keep non-null promises. No wonder Facebook call the non-null
type "**kills parent on exception**"!

```json title="Response"
{
  "data": null,
  //     üëÜ All of the data was destroyed, even the unrelated `you` field!
  "errors": [
    {
      "path": ["me"],
      "message": "Not logged in"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Schema best practice?

So when designing schemas it has been best practice to make fields nullable
unless we're fairly certain they won't error. This allows the client to retain
its resilience to errors, by rendering partially successful data.

But having null checks throughout our client sucks!

```tsx
if (data.me) {
  return <User user={data.me} />;
} else {
  // TODO: determine if this was an error null,
  // or just a non-existent user.
  return <NotFoundOrError />;
}
```

## The future of GraphQL nullability!

### Handling errors on the client

[`graphql-toe`](https://github.com/graphile/graphql-toe) is an npm module that
uses getters to reproduce server errors on the client by throwing when an
errored field is accessed:

```ts
import { toe } from "graphql-toe";
import { gql, request } from "graffle";

const response = await request("/graphql", document);
const dataAndErrors = toe(response);

dataAndErrors.you; // Returns {"name": "Jo"}
dataAndErrors.me; // ‚ÄºÔ∏è throws Error("Log in!") ‚ÄºÔ∏è
```

`graphql-toe` can be integrated into many frameworks in the JS ecosystem (Apollo
Client, urql, graffle, `fetch()`), but other frameworks may have their own
native error handling (e.g. Relay has the
[`@throwOnFieldError` directive](https://relay.dev/docs/guides/throw-on-field-error-directive/)
which can be applied to fragments).

By recombining `errors` back into `data` we no longer need GraphQL to bubble
nulls to keep its promise; since a `null` can never be read from an errored
position.

An "**error handling client**" is a client which prevents the user from reading
a `null` used as a placeholder for an error in a GraphQL response. The client
may do so by throwing when an errored field is accessed (as is the case for
[`graphql-toe`](https://github.com/graphile/graphql-toe)), or when a fragment
containing an error is read (as is the case for Relay's `@throwOnFieldError`
directive), or by preventing any data from being read if an error occurred (as
with Apollo Client's `errorPolicy: "none"`).

:::tip Error-handling clients are the future

Reproducing server errors on the client like this allows your developers to use
your language or framework's native error handling mechanisms, whether that be
`try`/`catch` or `<ErrorBoundary />` or whatever your language/framework
supports. No need for GraphQL-specific error handling within your components!

You can likely make your existing client an error-handling client today by
integrating `graphql-toe`, it's only 512 bytes gzipped! (You can also just
integrate the source code, it's less than 100 LOC in TypeScript and is MIT
licensed.)

:::

### Disabling error propagation and reflecting true nullability

If the client were to take responsibility for error handling by disabling null
bubbling and implementing a "throw on error" or similar behavior, we could
reflect the data's true nullability in the schema:

```graphql title="Query type"
type Query {
  you: User!
  me: User! # True nullability; client handles errors
}
```

Hooray for fewer null checks! üéâ

```tsx title="Before üòû"
if (data.me) {
  return <User user={data.me} />;
} else {
  // TODO: determine if this was an error null,
  // or just a non-existent user.
  return <NotFoundOrError />;
}
```

```tsx title="After ü§©"
return <User user={data.me} />;
```

_(Example assumes that your React application is already using
`<ErrorBoundary />` in a parent component.)_

:::tip Try it today!

Some GraphQL engines already support clients disabling error propagation via the
`@experimental_disableErrorPropagation` operation directive; but make sure that
you only use this with an error-handling client or you may get unexpected
results!

:::

### Supporting legacy clients

What does this mean for our existing deployed applications, for example mobile
apps on legacy devices that can no longer be updated? This is certainly a
critical concern for organizations such as Facebook!

If we introduce non-null in more places, this would have the effect of making
existing deployed applications less resilient to errors since errors will now
destroy even more of the returned data. For example, an application such as this
one that handles errors at the widget level:

<img
  alt="A legacy mobile application rendering many widgets, one of which has errored"
  src={LegacyAppWidgetError}
  style={{ maxWidth: "250px" }}
/>

might result in a full page error if we simply marked the type as non-nullable:

<img
  alt="A legacy mobile application rendering a full-page error"
  src={LegacyAppFullscreenError}
  style={{ maxWidth: "250px" }}
/>

This is much less useful for the user!

_(Thanks to v0 for generating these app mockups for me!)_

### The "transitional non-null" type

To support these legacy apps, I propose a "**transitional** non-null" type,
represented by the wildcard symbol `*`, that changes to either be nullable (`T*`
&rArr; `T`) for legacy/traditional apps or non-nullable (`T*` &rArr; `T!`) for
our future "error handling clients".

<img
  alt="Legacy and future apps side by side, handling errors gracefully thanks to transitional non-null type"
  src={EveryonesHappy}
  style={{ maxWidth: "500px", width: "100%" }}
/>

:::tip Use `graphql-sock` to convert these types

[`graphql-sock`](https://github.com/graphile/graphql-sock) is an npm module that
provides a CLI and TypeScript library capable of converting a "semantic
nullability" schema (that is to say one that supports the "semantic non null"
aka "transitional non null" type) into a schema with traditional syntax, either
by removing the semantic non-nullability for legacy clients
(`semantic-to-nullable`) or by replacing transitional/semantic non-null with the
traditional (strict) non-null for error-handling clients (`semantic-to-strict`).

Use it today to support both your legacy (`semantic-to-nullable`) and
error-handling (`semantic-to-strict`) applications' codegen, linting, and
similar needs.

:::

### New app? No new syntax!

The best part about this? If you're starting a new project from scratch and only
want to support error-handling clients, you'll never need to add this symbol or
any new directives to your schema or anywhere else! But with it, existing
schemas can allow new apps to leverage true nullability in the schema, without
breaking existing clients. Everybody wins!
